<h2>THE APOLOGY.</h2>


<p>I would not have thought of inflicting a book on
my long-suffering fellow-countrymen, but for the
wish expressed by my publishers: for</p>

<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div>“Every fool describes in these bright days</div>
<div>His wondrous journey to some Foreign Court.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>In Afghanistan however, difficult of access, and
hence comparatively unknown, there have been,
since that strong man Amîr Abdurrahman ascended
the Throne, such remarkable changes in the administration
of the country, and such strides towards
civilization, that it was thought a narrative of life
there, throwing, possibly, some light on the personality
of the Monarch, and on the “bent” of the people,
might be of general interest.</p>

<p>The book has been written in the intervals of
professional work, and, with its shortcomings of
diction and style, the only merit it can claim&mdash;that
of “local colour”&mdash;is due to the fact that it was
compiled from the letters I wrote from Afghanistan
to her who is now my wife.</p>

<p>It was with no small amount of pleasurable excitement
that I donned the Afghan turban, and
with Sir Salter (then Mr.) Pyne and two other
English engineers, started from Peshawur for Kabul
to enter the service of the Amîr.</p>

<p>I had made the acquaintance of Mr. Pyne
in London, where I was holding a medical appointment.
He had returned to England, after his first
short visit to Kabul, with orders from the Amîr to
buy machinery, procure engineering assistants, and
engage the services of an English surgeon.</p>

<p>I gathered from his yarns that, for Europeans
at the present day, life among the Afghans was
likely to be a somewhat different thing from what
it was a few years ago.</p>

<p>In the reigns of Dost Mahomed and Shere Ali
it was simply an impossibility for a European to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
take up a permanent residence in Afghanistan; in
fact, except for occasional political missions, none
was allowed to enter the country.</p>

<p>We do, indeed, hear of one or two, travelling
in disguise, who managed to gather valuable facts
concerning the country and its inhabitants, but we
learn from their narratives that the hardships they
were forced to undergo were appalling. For ages
it has been a proverb among the natives of India
that he who goes to Kabul carries his life in his
hand. They say, “Trust a cobra, but never an
Afghan;” and there is no denying the fact that
the people of Afghanistan have had the credit from
time immemorial of being a turbulent nation of
highway robbers and murderers. If there were any
chance of plunder they spared not even their co-religionists,
and, being fanatical Mahomedans, they
were particularly “down” on any unfortunate
traveller suspected of being a Feringhi and an
infidel.</p>

<p>A busy professional life following upon the
engrossing studies of Hospital and University, had
given me neither time nor any particular inducement
to read about Afghanistan, so that when I left
England I knew very little about the country.
However, on reaching India I found plenty of
people ready enough to enlighten me.</p>

<p>I heard, from officers who had been on active
service in Afghanistan in 1880, of the treacherous
and vindictive nature of the people; of the danger
when they were in Kabul of walking in the town
except in a party of six or seven; of the men who,
even taking this precaution, had been stabbed. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
heard, too, a great deal about the assassination of
the British envoy in Kabul, Sir Louis Cavagnari,
in 1879; of the highway dangers of the two hundred
mile ride from the British frontier to Kabul, and,
remembering that we were about to trust our lives
absolutely for some years to the good faith of these
proverbially treacherous Afghans, it struck me we
were in for an experience that was likely to be
exciting.</p>

<p>What actually happened I will relate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Departure from Peshawur.</div>

<p>We were all ready to start from Peshawur one
day in March, 1889. The Amîr’s agent, a stout and
genial old Afghan, named Abdul Khalik Khan, had
provided us with turbans, tents, and horses; we had
received permits from the Government to cross the
frontier, and our baggage was being loaded on the
pack-horses when a telegram arrived directing us to
await further orders. We were informed that there
was fighting among the Pathans in the Khyber, and
we were to postpone our departure till it was over.
This seemed a healthy commencement.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards, however, we were allowed
to proceed. The first day’s march was short, simply
from the cantonment across the dusty Peshawur
plain to Jumrûd fort: about nine miles. The fort,
originally built by the Sikhs in 1837, has been repaired
and strengthened by the British, who now hold
it. It is said, however, to be of no very great value:
one reason being because of the possibility of its
water supply being cut off at any time by the Afghan
hillmen.</p>

<p>The servants, with the pack-horses and tents,
took up their quarters in the courtyard, but we four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
accompanied the officer in charge up to his rooms in
the watch-tower. From here we had an extensive
view over the Peshawur valley. The entry to the
Khyber was about three miles off to the west. We
had left the cantonment early in the afternoon, and
soon after our arrival it became dark. We dined, and
were thinking of turning in to prepare for our long
hot ride on the morrow, when we found, instead, that
we should have to turn out.</p>

<p>The fort was not an hotel, and had no sleeping
accommodation to offer us. I looked at Pyne. The
baggage was down there in the courtyard, somewhere
in the dark, and our bedding with it. Should
we&mdash;&mdash;? No! we would roll up our coats for
pillows, throw our ulsters over us, and sleep on the
platform outside the tower. We were proud to do it.
But&mdash;the expression “bed and board” appealed to my
feelings ever afterwards.</p>

<p>We had an early breakfast.</p>

<p>In the morning we found the guard of Afghan
cavalry waiting for us in the travellers’ caravansary
near the fort. There were about forty troopers&mdash;“the
Amîr’s tag-rag,” as the British subalterns
disrespectfully called them.</p>

<p>They were rough-looking men, dressed more or
less alike, with turbans, tunics, trousers, and long
boots. Each had a carbine slung over his shoulder
and a sword at his side. A cloak or a rug was rolled
up in front of the saddle and a couple of saddle bags
strapped behind. They carried no tents. I cannot
say they looked smart, but they looked useful. Of
the individual men some were rather Jewish in type,
good-looking fellows&mdash;these were Afghans; and one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
or two had high cheek-bones and small eyes&mdash;they
were Hazaras. All were very sunburnt, and very
few wore beards. This last fact surprised me; I had
thought that Mahomedans never shaved the beard.</p>

<p>It is, however, not at all an uncommon thing for
soldiers and officers in the Afghan army to shave all
but the moustache; but I learnt that in a Kabul court
of law, when it is necessary in swearing to lay the
hand upon the beard, that a soldier’s oath is not
taken: he has no beard to swear by.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Khyber Pass.</div>

<p>The baggage was sent off under a guard of about a
dozen troopers. We followed with the rest and entered
the gorge of the Khyber. It is a holiday trip now-a-days
to ride or drive into the Pass. You obtain a
permit from the Frontier Political Officer, and are provided
with a guard of two native cavalrymen, who
conduct you through the Pass as far as Landi Kotal.
This is allowed, however, on only two days in the
week, Mondays and Thursdays&mdash;the Koffla, or merchant
days. The Khyber Pathans have entered into an
agreement with the Government that for the payment
of a certain subsidy they will keep the Pass
open on those two days: will forbear to rob travellers
and merchants. Doubtless it is an act of great self-denial
on their part, but they keep faith.</p>

<p>Riding along the Pass one sees posted at intervals,
on rock or peak, the Pathan sentry keeping guard.
He is a fine-looking man, as he stands silently in his
robes: tall, with black beard and moustache. His
head may be shaven or his long hair hang in ringlets
over his shoulders. He wears a little skull cap
with, may be, a blue turban wound carelessly round
it: a loose vest reaching the knee is confined at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
waist by the ample folds of the cummerbund, or waist
shawl. In this is thrust a pistol or two and a big
ugly-looking knife. The short trousers of cotton,
reaching half-way down the leg, are loose and not
confined at the ankle like the townsman’s “pyjamas.”
On the feet he wears the Afghan shoe with curved
up toe: the ornamental chapli or sandal of leather:
or one neatly made of straw. Draped with classical
beauty around the shoulders is the large blue cotton
lûngi, or cloak. If the morning is cold the sheepskin
postîn is worn, the sleeves of which reach to the elbow.
If it rain the postîn is reversed, and the wool being
outside shoots the wet off. The next day’s sun
dries it.</p>

<p>The rifle he has may be an old English musket,
a Martini-Henry or a native jezail, but, whatever
it be, in the Pathan’s hands it is deadly.</p>

<p>The scenery in the Khyber is rugged and wild,
the only vegetation being stunted bushes and trees
at the bottom of the gorge. The rocky cliffs rise
precipitously on either side, and gradually closing in,
are, at a little distance from the entry, not more
than three or four hundred feet apart. The road
at one time leads by the stream at the bottom of
the gorge, and later creeping up the mountain it
winds in and out round the spurs or fissures half-way
up the face of the cliff. It is a good broad road,
made, and kept in excellent repair, by the British.
Nevertheless, I was far from happy: my mare,
accustomed to a town, was frightened by the rocks,
the sharp turns, and the precipices, and desired to
escape somewhere, anywhere&mdash;and there was no
parapet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Eccentricities of Rosinante.</div>

<p>By-and-bye, however, we descended and were in a
stony valley, for the Pass varies in width from ten or
twelve feet to over a hundred yards. Mr. Pyne
suggested a canter. A canter! I knew the mare
by this time, and I had on only a hunting bit. Off
we went. Pyne had a good horse, a Kataghani that
had been given him in Kabul, but we swept ahead,
my bony mare and I, much to Pyne’s disgust&mdash;and
mine, for I couldn’t hold her. Roads! what were
roads to her? Away she went straight up the valley,
and such a valley! The ground was covered with
pebbles and big stones, and cut up by dry water-courses
wide and narrow. The narrower gulleys
she cleared at a bound, the wider she went headlong
into and out of before I had time to hope anything.
I soon was far ahead of the guard, only the Captain
managed to keep somewhere in my wake, shouting,
“Khubardar,” “Take care!” I yearned to khubardar
with a great yearn, for in addition to the danger
of breaking my neck was that of being shot. Sawing
at the reins did not check her, and at last I flung
myself back, caught the cantle of the saddle with
my right hand, and jerked at the curb. I was tossed
in the air at every stride, and my loaded revolver
thumped my hip at each bound, but her speed
diminished, and at last she gave in and stopped,
panting and snorting. Then the Captain came
clattering up, and I was obliged to turn the mare
round and round or she would have been off again.
The Captain smiled and said, “Khob asp,” “It is
a good horse.”</p>

<p>“Bally,” I said, which means “Yes.”</p>

<p>We adjusted the saddle and waited till the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
came up. Pyne remonstrated with me and told me I
ought not to have done such a thing, it was not safe!
He viewed it as a piece of eccentricity on my part.</p>

<p>About eight miles from Jumrûd, and where the
defile is narrow and precipitous, is the Ali Musjid
fort. This is built on a high, nearly isolated, rocky
hill to the left or south of the road. The small
Musjid, or Mosque, from which the place takes its
name, stands by the stream at the bottom of the
defile. It was erected, according to tradition, by
the Caliph Ali. The fort, which is called the key
of the Khyber, has at different times been in
possession of Afghans and British. We hold it now.
The last man we dislodged was General Gholam
Hyder Khan, Orak zai, who was then in the service
of Amîr Yakûb Khan. He is now Commander-in-Chief
of the Amîr’s army in Kabul and Southern
Afghanistan. He is a big stout man, about six feet
three inches in height. When I saw him in Kabul
he did not seem to bear any malice on account of his
defeat. There is another General Gholam Hyder,
a short man, who is Commander-in-Chief in Turkestan,
and of whom I shall have occasion to speak hereafter.</p>

<p>At Ali Musjid we sat by the banks of the streamlet
and hungrily munched cold chicken and bread; for
Mr. Pyne had suggested at breakfast our tucking
something into our holsters in case of necessity: he
had been there before.</p>

<p>Beyond Ali Musjid the narrow defile extended
some distance, and then gradually widening out we
found ourselves on an elevated plateau or table-land,
bounded by not very high hills. The plain was some
miles in extent, and we saw Pathan villages dotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
here and there, with cornfields surrounding them.
The villages were fortified. They were square, surrounded
by a high wall with one heavy gate, and with
a tower at one or all four corners. The houses or
huts were arranged inside in a row against the wall,
and being flat roofed and the outer wall loopholed
there was at once a “banquette” ready for use in
case the village should be attacked.</p>

<p>The mountains and valleys of the Khyber range
and of the other Indian frontier mountains are
inhabited by these semi-independent Afghans called,
collectively, Pathans or Pukhtana. There are many
learned and careful men among the Government
frontier officers who are at present investigating the
origin and descent of the Pathan tribes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pathans; their Appearance and Customs.</div>

<p>The Khyberi Pathan whom I have described as
the “guard” of the Pass is a fair type of the rest.
The men are quarrelsome, are inveterate thieves,
but are good fighters. Many of them enter the
British service and make excellent soldiers. They
are divided into a great number of different tribes,
all speaking the same language, Pukhtu, or Pushtu,
and bound by the same code of unwritten law, the
Pukhtanwali. The neighbouring tribes, however, are
jealous of one another and rarely intermarry. There
is the vendetta, or law of retaliation, among them,
and almost always an ancient feud exists between
neighbouring villages. The women, unlike the
Mahomedan townswomen, are not closely veiled; the
head is covered by a blue or white cotton shawl, which,
when a stranger approaches, is drawn across the
lower part of the face. They wear a long dark-blue
robe reaching midway between knee and ankle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
decorated on the breast and at the hem with designs
in red. The feet are generally bare, and the loose
trousers are drawn tight at the ankle. Their black
hair hangs in two long plaits, the points being fastened
with a knot of many-coloured silks.</p>

<p>When one considers the nature of these
mountaineers&mdash;hereditary highway robbers and
fighters, crack shots, agile and active, and when one
observes the unlimited possibility they have among
rocks, valleys, and passes of surprising a hostile
army and of escaping themselves&mdash;the advantage
of a “subsidy” becomes apparent.</p>

<p>At the distant or west extremity of the plateau,
where we saw the Pathan villages, is the Landi Kotal
serai. An ordinary caravansary in Afghanistan is a
loopholed enclosure with one gate, and is very like
the forts or villages I have described. At Landi
Kotal, in addition to the native serai, is one built by
the Government. It is strongly fortified, with bastion,
embrasure, and banquette, and any part of the
enclosure commanded by the adjoining hills is protected
by a curtain or traverse.</p>

<p>Hot, tired, and thirsty, we four rode into the fort,
and were received by the British officer in charge.
The Afghan guard took up their quarters in the
native serai outside. Good as the road was it had
seemed an endless journey. Winding in and out in
the heat we had seemed to make but little progress, and
the unaccustomed weight of the turban and the dragging
of the heavy revolver added considerably to our
fatigue; but the march, after all, was not more than
five-and-twenty miles.</p>

<p>This time there was ample accommodation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
us, and after an excellent dinner, the last I had
in British territory for many a long month, we
turned in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Shenwaris: Caravan of Traders.</div>

<p>After Landi Kotal, the Khyber narrows up. We
wound in and out round the fissures and water
channels in the face of the mountain, and climbed up
and down as before; but presently the guard unslung
their carbines and closed in round us. It was the
Shenwari country we were now traversing, and
these Pathans, even by the Amîr’s soldiers, are
considered dangerous; for what says the proverb,
“A snake, a Shenwari, and a scorpion, have never
a heart to tame.” The Amîr had, however, partly
subjugated them even then, and a tower of skulls
stood on a hill outside Kabul.</p>

<p>Then we came to a series of small circular dusty
valleys surrounded by rocky mountains. There was
nothing green, and the heat was very great, it seemed
to be focussed from the rocks. Further on we caught
up with a caravan of travelling merchants with their
camels and pack-horses.</p>

<p>These men belong almost entirely to a tribe of
Afghans called Lohani. They come from the
mountains about Ghazni. In the autumn they travel
down to India with their merchandise and go about
by rail and steamer to Bombay, Karachi, Burma, and
other places for the purposes of trade. In the spring
they go northward to Kabul, Herat, and Bokhara.
Under the present Amîr they can travel in Afghanistan
without much danger, but in the reigns of
Shere Ali and Dost Mahomed they had practically to
fight their way.</p>

<p>They go by the name of Povindia, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Persian word Parwinda, “a bale of merchandise.”
When I was in Turkestan I became acquainted with
one of these men. He was a white bearded old
Afghan who had been, he told me, to China, Moscow,
and even to Paris. He tried to sell me a small
nickel-plated Smith and Wesson revolver.</p>

<p>We rode by the caravan of traders and reached
Dakka, on the banks of the Kabul river. This is
the first station belonging to the Amîr. The Colonel
commanding came out to receive us, and conducted us
to a tent on the bank, where we sat and drank tea.
We were much interested in watching some Afghans
swimming down the river buoyed up by inflated
skins&mdash;“mussaks.” Grasping the skin in their arms
they steered with their legs, the force of the current
carrying them rapidly along. Two men took a
donkey across. They made a raft by lashing four or
five skins to some small branches; and tying the
donkey’s legs together, they heaved him sideways on
to the raft. Clinging to the skins they pushed off,
and, striking out with the legs, they were carried
across in a diagonal direction. By-and-bye some
men floated by on a rough raft made of logs. They
were taking the wood to India for sale.</p>

<p>The river here, though not very deep, is
dangerous, on account of the diverse currents.</p>

<p>In the centre, to the depth of three or four feet,
the current runs rapidly down the river; deeper it
either runs up the river or goes much slower than
the surface water.</p>

<p>A few years later I was travelling past here, one
hot summer, with Mr. Arthur Collins, recently
geologist to the Amîr, and we determined to bathe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Mr. Collins, who was a strong swimmer, swam out into
the middle: I paddled near the bank where the current
was sweeping strongly <em>up</em> stream. Mr. Collins, out
in the middle, was suddenly turned head over heels
and sucked under. He could not get to the surface,
and, therefore, swam under water, happily in the
right direction, and he came up very exhausted near
the bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camp at Bassawal.</div>

<p>After resting, we rode on through some hot
pebbly valleys, with no sign of vegetation, until we
reached Bassawal, where we camped. The tents were
put up, sentries posted, and the servants lit wood
fires to prepare dinner. It soon became dark, for the
twilight is very short. We were advised to have no
light in our tent, lest the tribes near might take a
shot at us; and we dined in the dark. It was the
first night I had ever spent in a tent, and to me it
seemed a mad thing to go to bed under such circumstances.
I remember another night I spent near
here some years afterwards, but that I will speak of
later.</p>

<p>On this occasion the night passed quietly.</p>

<p>The next morning they woke us before daybreak.
The cook had lit a fire and prepared breakfast&mdash;fried
eggs, tinned tongue, and tea. As soon as we were
dressed the tents were struck, and while we were
breakfasting the baggage was loaded up. We had
camp chairs and a little portable iron table, but its
legs became bent, and our enamelled iron plates had
a way of slipping off, so that we generally used a mule
trunk instead. The baggage was sent off, and we
sat on the ground and smoked. Starting about an
hour afterwards, we rode along through fertile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
valleys with cornfields in them: here water for
irrigation could be obtained. In March the corn was
a foot high. Then we rode across a large plain
covered with a coarse grass. It was not cultivated
because of the impossibility of obtaining water. We
camped further on in the Chahardeh valley, which
was partly cultivated and partly covered with the
coarse grass. The tents were put up near a clump
of trees, where there was a well. Unfortunately,
there was also the tomb of some man of importance,
and other graves, near the well. The water we had
from it tasted very musty and disagreeable. Next
day we went through other cultivated valleys to the
mountains again. The river here made a curve to
the south, and the mountains came close up to the
bank. The road, cut out of the face of the mountain,
ran sometimes level with the bank, sometimes
a hundred feet or more above it. It was much
pleasanter than the Khyber Pass, for to the north
(our right) there was the broad Kabul river,
with cultivated fields on its northern bank, and
though the scorching heat of the sun was reflected
from the rocks there was a cool breeze blowing. I
thought it was a wonderfully good road for native
make, but I found, on enquiry, that it had been
made by the British during the Afghan war.</p>

<p>After rounding a shoulder of the mountain, where
the road was high above the river, we could see in
the distance the Jelalabad Plain and the walled city of
Jelalabad. However, it was a long way off and we
had to ride some hours before we reached it.</p>

<p>When on a journey in Afghanistan it is not usual
to trot or canter, in fact, the natives never trot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
They ride at a quick shuffling walk: the horse’s near-side
feet go forward together, and his off-side feet
together&mdash;a camel’s walk. It is an artificial pace,
but very restful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Advantages of Cultivation.</div>

<p>There was a shorter route which we could have
taken from Bassawal, avoiding Jelalabad altogether,
but it was mostly over pebbly hills and desert plains,
and was exceeding hot. From Dacca we had kept
fairly close to, though not actually in sight of, the
Kabul river. It makes a vast difference to one’s
comfort in a tropical or semi-tropical country to
travel through cultivated land where, if only at
intervals, there is something green to be seen. Few
things are more fatiguing than the glare of a desert
and the reflected heat from pebbles and rocks; we,
therefore, chose the longer but pleasanter route.</p>

<p>We arrived at Jelalabad about the middle of the
afternoon. The town is fortified; surrounded by a
high wall, with bastions and loopholes; and is in a
good state of repair. We entered one of the massive
gates, rode through the bazaars to the Palace. The
bazaars, like those of Kabul, are roughly roofed over
to keep out the glare of the sun.</p>

<p>The Governor of Jelalabad received us in the
Palace gardens: seats were placed in the shade: fans
were waved by the page boys to keep off the flies;
and a crowd of people stood around. Sweets were
brought&mdash;chiefly sugared almonds&mdash;then tea and
cigarettes, and bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>We rested for a while, and as we smoked the
Governor made the usual polite Oriental speeches.
Then he invited us to see the interior of the Palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
It is a large white building, standing in the midst of
well laid out gardens, in which are many varieties of
Eastern and European fruit-trees and flowers. The
Palace was semi-European in its internal decoration.
It was unfinished at this time. There was a large
central hall with a domed roof, and smaller rooms at
the side: a separate enclosure was built for the ladies
of the harem: near by were kitchens, rooms for
the Afghan bath, and a Guest house or pavilion in a
garden of its own.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jelalabad.</div>

<p>The town of Jelalabad is between ninety and a
hundred miles from the Indian frontier town
Peshawur, and contains, in the summer, a population
of from three to four thousand inhabitants. There
is one chief bazaar or street with shops. The other
streets are very narrow. Though much smaller it
resembles in style the city of Kabul, which I will
describe presently.</p>

<p>The spot was chosen by Bâber Bâdshah, the
Tartar king, founder of the Mogul dynasty of
Afghanistan and India. He laid out some gardens
here, but the town of Jelalabad was built by his
grandson, Jelaluddin Shah, also called Akbar, in
1560 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, just about the time when Queen Elizabeth
came to the throne. The place is interesting to us
from the famous defence of Sir Robert Sale during
the first Afghan war, when he held the town from
November, 1841, to April, 1842.</p>

<p>The river which runs near the town is here broad
and rapid, though shallow and with low banks. All
along the river for miles the plain is marshy and
overgrown with reeds. In the summer when the
swamp is more or less dried up, one rides through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the reeds rather than keep to the glare and heat of
the road. The plain of Jelalabad, nearly two
thousand feet above the sea, is about twenty miles
long, that is, from east to west, and four or five
miles wide. Wherever it can be irrigated from the
Kabul river it is delightfully fertile, but everywhere
else it is hot barren desert. The climate of Jelalabad
is much more tropical than that of Kabul&mdash;more
resembling the climate of Central India; and in
the winter the nomadic Afghans of the hills in the
Kabul province pack their belongings on donkeys or
bullocks, and with their whole families move down to
Jelalabad, so that the winter population of the town
is enormously greater than that of the summer.</p>

<p>Palm trees and oranges grow out in the gardens:
pomegranates and grapes in great quantities; and
there are many kinds of tropical as well as sub-tropical
flowers. His Highness the Amîr had an
idea a short time ago of establishing a tea plantation
here. It is doubtful, however, whether it would be
successful, for in the summer there is the dust storm
and the scorching wind&mdash;the simûm.</p>

<p>After taking leave of the Governor we were
shown into the Guest pavilion in its enclosed garden.
Here arrangements had been made for us to spend
the night. On the north side, where the pavilion
overlooks the Kabul river, was a stone colonnade or
verandah with pillars. A sentry was stationed here
and also at the gate of the garden. One of the
Khans had asked permission to entertain us at dinner,
and with Afghan hospitality he provided also for the
guard, servants, and horses. He did not dine with us
but came in afterwards for a chat. I noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
in spite of being a Mahomedan he did not refuse a
cigarette and some whiskey. This gentleman we
were told had considerable power in the neighbourhood
of Gundamuk, and we were advised, in case it should
ever be necessary to escape from Kabul, to remember
his friendliness; for though Gundamuk is a long
way from Kabul, one could ride there in a day.</p>

<p>Next day we had a gallop through the fertile
part of the valley. I had changed my mare for a
steadier horse and my mind was peaceful. Away to
the south it was stony and bare, and in the distance
we could see the snow-capped range of the Suffêd
Koh or White Mountains. We did not go very many
miles, but put up at the village of Tattang. Some
of the villages are built entirely as forts, resembling
those in the Khyber district. In others there is a
similar but smaller fort, which is occupied by the
Malek or some rich man with his immediate retainers;
the other houses, flat topped and built of sun-dried
bricks, are clumped irregularly together near the fort.
But the windows, for safety and to ensure privacy,
generally open into a walled garden or yard, so that
even these have the appearance of being fortified.
The villages are surrounded by orchards and fields.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gunpowder Factory at Tattang.</div>

<p>At Tattang the Amîr has a gunpowder factory,
and the superintendent showed us over it. The
machinery is of wood, roughly made, and is worked
by water power. The water is obtained from a
stream rising in the Suffêd Koh mountains, and is
led by broad channels to the water wheels. Along
the channels, and indeed along most of the irrigation
canals that one sees in the country, are planted
poplars or willows; these protect the canal banks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
from injury, and possibly lessen by their shade
the rapid evaporation of water that takes place in
a dry hot climate. The gunpowder is not for sale,
and severe penalties are inflicted on those detected
selling or stealing any.</p>

<p>The following day we left the cultivated part of the
valley and rode through a stony desert and over pebbly
mountains to Nimla. Contrasted with the pleasant
ride through the fields of the day before, the heat
and glare were most oppressive. The Nimla valley is,
however, an oasis in the desert. In it there is a very
beautiful garden enclosed within a high wall. It was
made by Shah Jehangir about 1610 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>, and has been
repaired by the present Amîr. One can see the
garden a great way off, the deep green of its cypress
trees being a striking piece of colour among the
blue greys and reds of the mountainous barren
landscape. There is an avenue of these trees about
one hundred feet wide, and between them, from one
end of the garden to the other, rushes a broad stream
with three cascades artificially made and enclosed
within a stone embankment. The water is brought
from a stream rising in the Suffêd Koh mountains,
and rushes on to join the Surkhâb, a branch of the
Kabul river.</p>

<p>At one end of the avenue is a pavilion surrounded
by flowers. Here we put up for the night. Soldiers
were sent off to the nearest villages to buy provisions,
and our Hindustani cook, having dug a shallow hole
in the ground in which to build his wood fire, placed
a couple of stones on each side to support his pots,
and sent us an excellent dinner of soup, roast fowl,
and custard pudding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Suffêd Koh, or White Mountains.</div>

<p>We started off early next morning. Leaving the
Nimla valley we had a rough road, often no more
than a dry watercourse which led up over rocky
mountains and across stony plains for many miles.
As we were travelling westward, on our left hand,
that is to the south, could be seen the great range
of mountains called the Suffêd Koh, on the other
side of which is the Kurram valley, now occupied
by the British. This range forms the southern
boundary of the Kabul province, and extending from
the Khyber mountains had been on our left the whole
way. Our route, however, had been somewhat north-west,
for we had kept fairly close to although not
on the banks of the Kabul river, but at Jelalabad
we branched off from the river south-west, and came
much closer to the Suffêd Koh.</p>

<p>This range, unlike the other mountains we saw, is
covered with great forests of trees. In the whole
country the arboreal distribution is peculiar. The
forests are confined entirely to the main ranges of
mountains and their immediate offshoots. The more
distant prolongations are bare and rocky. I remember
once in travelling from Turkestan to Kabul, everyone
stopped and stared, for there on a mountain a solitary
tree could be seen; it looked most extraordinary. In
the valleys there are poplars and willows, which have
been planted by the peasants for use afterwards as
roofing beams, and there are orchards of fruit-trees,
but I never saw a forest, a wood, nor even a spinney.
The species of tree on those mountains where they are
to be found, varies, of course, according to the height
you find them growing. For instance, high up, there
are the cone-bearing trees, the various kinds of pine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and fir. Then come the yew and the hazel, the
walnut and the oak. Lower down&mdash;to 3,000 feet&mdash;are
wild olives, acacias, and mimosas. On the terminal
ridges you find simply shrubs and herbs.</p>

<p>We passed Gundamuk, where in May, 1879, the
“Treaty of Peace” was signed by the reigning Amîr
Yakoub and by Sir Louis Cavagnari. Four months
later, in September, Cavagnari, while British Resident
in Kabul, was assassinated with the connivance of the
same Amîr. I heard the whole plot of the assassination
when I was in Kabul.</p>

<p>The story was this. Cavagnari had been holding
Durbars, giving judgment in cases of dispute brought
to him by the natives, and had been distributing
money freely, till the Sirdars, coming to Amîr Yakoub,
said, “No longer is the Amîr King of Afghanistan,
Cavagnari is King.” Yakoub therefore took counsel
with his Sirdars as to the best course to adopt. They
said, “To-morrow the Herati regiments come for
their pay&mdash;send them to Cavagnari.” It was crafty
advice&mdash;they knew the hot fiery nature of the Heratis.
The following day, when the troops appeared, unarmed,
as is the custom on these occasions, Amîr Yakoub sent
word, “Go to Cavagnari&mdash;he is your King.” Off
rushed the soldiers tumultuously, knowing the Englishman
had been lavish with money. The Sikh sentry
at the Residency Gate, seeing a great crowd rushing
to the Bala Hissar, challenged them. The excited
shouts of the crowd being no answer, he fired. At
once their peaceable though noisy excitement changed
to anger, and they retaliated with a shower of stones.
The Residency guard were called out, some of the
Afghans rushed back for their rifles, and soon all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were furiously fighting, though no one but Yakoub
and his Sirdars knew why. Messages were sent to
Amîr Yakoub, and the answer he returned was, “If
God will, I am making preparations.” The end was
the massacre of the British Envoy and all with him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Commencement of Ascent to Kabul.</div>

<p>About ten miles beyond Gundamuk was Surkh
pul, or “The Red Bridge.” This is an ancient brick
bridge built over the river Surkâb, which runs into
the Kabul river near Jelalabad. The bridge is built
high up at a wild looking gorge between precipitous
red mountains, and the river comes roaring out
into the valley. The water of the river is reddish,
or dark-brown, from the colour of the mud in
suspension; however, the Afghans said it was good
water, and while we sat in the shade of a fakir’s
hut there, the servants boiled some of the water
and gave us tea. Then we crossed the bridge and
rode on again. From here, almost to the Kabul
valley, the road is through a very wild and desolate
mountainous region; you gradually rise higher and
higher, to nearly 8,000 feet, but just before you reach
Kabul, descend some 2,000 feet, the valley of Kabul
being 6,000 feet above the sea. It is, of course, a very
great deal colder in this region than in Jelalabad; in
fact, while the harvest is being reaped in Jelalabad,
the corn at Gundamuk, only twenty-five miles further
on, is but an inch or two above the ground. It
would, perhaps, be more accurate to say that the ascent
commences at Nimla. We rode some miles between
two ranges of hills&mdash;the long narrow valley being cut
across by spurs from the mountains; then climbed a
very long steep ascent, with precipitous walls of rock
on either side, and descended a narrow winding gorge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
which appeared to have been once the bed of a river.
On either side of this gorge there was brushwood
growing, some stunted holly trees, and what looked
like twisted boxwood trees. Then we climbed the
mountain, on the top of which is the Jigdilik serai.
This is 6,200 feet high, and the scenery from the serai
is the abomination of desolation&mdash;range after range of
barren mountains. It felt bitterly cold up there, after
the heat we had been through.</p>

<p>They found us a room over the gateway of the
serai, lit a blazing wood fire, and we stayed there till
the next day. In the first Afghan war in 1837, during
the winter retreat of the British army, of the 5,000
soldiers and 11,000 camp followers who left Kabul,
only 300 reached Jigdilik, and of these only one,
Dr. Brydon, reached Jelalabad, the others were shot
down by the Afghans, or died of cold and exposure.</p>

<p>The village of Jigdilik is not on the hill where the
serai is situated, but in the valley at the foot. Here
three gorges meet. One was the road by which the ill-fated
army came in their retreat from Kabul through
the Khurd Kabul Pass. We took another road to the
north-west. We climbed up and down over steep
mountains and through narrow defiles hemmed in by
bare rocks. In the valleys it was rare to see anything
but stones, rocks, and pebbles. There was one valley
at Katasung where there was a little stream with
grass growing by it. This valley, a short time ago,
was very dangerous to travel through on account of
the highway robberies and murders of a tribe living
near. It is safer now, for the Amîr has killed some
of them, imprisoned others, and dispersed the rest.
We camped at Sei Baba, a narrow valley of pebbles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
with a small stream trickling through it. An enterprising
peasant, finding water there, had picked all
the pebbles off a narrow strip of ground, piled them
in a ring round his field, led the water by a trench to
it, and had planted some corn. He, however, was
nowhere to be seen, nor was there any house or hut
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Irrigation Terraces.</div>

<p>We occasionally came across these patches among
the mountains wherever there was a trickle of water
to be obtained. Sometimes they were more extensive
than this one, and, if made on the slope of the
mountain, the ground was carefully dug and built up
into terraces, so that irrigation was possible. In
the middle of the Sei Baba valley was a tomb with
a low wall all round it, and a solitary tree was
growing by. On the tomb were placed two or three
pairs of horns of the wild goat. This is done as a
mark of great respect. Every passer by, too, throws
a stone on a heap by the grave, and strokes his beard
while he mutters a prayer. The heap of stones, or
“tsalai,” is supposed to be piled only over the graves
of holy men or martyrs; but they are heaped over
any grave that happens to be apart from others, and
by the wayside. The peasants, not knowing, assume
it is the grave of a holy man. The custom is said
by some to originate by imitation from an act of
Mahomed, in which the form but not the spirit of
the ceremony, has been retained; for Mahomed, fleeing
for refuge to Mecca from Medina, threw stones at
the city and cursed it. By others, these heaps of
stones are supposed to be representative of the
Buddhist funeral pillars, the custom having remained
extant since the days when Buddhism was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
dominant religion of the people inhabiting this
country. The latter seems the more likely explanation.</p>

<p>By the side of some of these tombs a small shrine,
“ziyârat,” is built. If the tomb is that of a known
holy man, the passer by, in addition to adding a stone
and saying his prayer, calls upon the name of the saint,
and tears a small piece of rag off his garment which
he hangs on the nearest bush or tree. The shred is
to remind the holy man that the wearer has prayed
him to intercede on his behalf with the prophet
Mahomed. On the grave, too, is generally planted a
pole with an open hand, cut out of zinc or tin, fixed
on the top. If the deceased has fallen in battle a red
rag is fixed on the pole as well. What the open hand
pointing to the sky represents I never heard.</p>

<p>When we arrived at Sei Baba we found that a
party of peasants on the tramp had halted there&mdash;one
of their number died just as we arrived. Seeing that
we had a cavalcade of horsemen and much baggage,
and there being no village nearer than seven or eight
miles, they came to us to beg a little calico for a
winding sheet. It struck me that ten yards, the
amount they asked for, was rather much for that
purpose. Possibly they thought the living men
required it quite as much as the dead man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iron Cage.</div>

<p>Next day we had a high and stony range of
mountains to climb&mdash;the Lataband Pass, nearly eight
thousand feet above the sea. This part of the journey
between Lataband and Chinár, with the winding rocky
road curving high up round the spurs or plunging
into narrow ravines, always seems to me the wildest
and most weird of all. The mountains are so huge
and rocky, the ravines so precipitous, and the silence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
so appalling. A few years ago the Pass was dangerous
not only in itself&mdash;the road in one place runs on
a ledge of rock overhanging a seemingly bottomless
precipice&mdash;but it was infested with Afghan highway
robbers. Being comparatively near the capital this
was particularly exasperating to the Amîr. Finding
ordinary punishments of no avail he determined to
make an example of the next man apprehended. As
we were riding along we could see fixed on one of
the highest peaks something that looked in the
distance like a flagstaff. The road winding on we
drew nearer, and saw it was not a flag, it was too
globular, and it did not move in the wind. When we
got right under the peak we saw it was a great iron
cage fixed on the top of a mast. The robber had
been made an example of. There was nothing left in
the cage but his bones. I never heard of there being
any more highway robbery or murder near here.</p>

<p>From this pass you get the first view of Kabul.
In the distance it seems a beautiful place, and after
the long desolate march the sight of it lying in the
green Kabul valley is delightful. We reached the
foot of the mountains, rode some miles along a stony
and barren plain till we reached a village called
Butkhak, where we camped. The next day the
cultivated part of the Kabul valley lay before us.
First were the fields surrounding Butkhak, then we
crossed a small dilapidated brick bridge over the
Logar river, which runs north to join the Kabul
river. We had quite lost sight of our old friend
the Kabul river since we left Jelalabad: he was away
somewhere to the north of us, cutting a path for
himself among the mountains. The Amîr has spent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
several thousands of pounds&mdash;or rather lacs of rupees&mdash;in
trying to make a road in the course of the river
from Kabul to Jelalabad, but it was found quite
impracticable among the mountains in the Lataband
and Chinár district. The object, of course, was to
avoid the climb over the Lataband Pass. I have never
been the route through the Khurd Kabul Pass to
Jigdilik, but I have heard that the road is not very
good.</p>

<p>After crossing the Logar bridge we mounted a
range of low pebbly hills, which run irregularly
east across the valley, cutting it in two. From the
elevated ground we could see on our left a large
reed grown marsh surrounded by meadow land, which
ran right up to the foot of the mountains, forming
the south boundary of the valley. We were much
nearer to the southern than to the northern limit.
The mountains curved round in front of us and we
could see the gap or gorge between the Asmai and
Shere Derwaza mountains. From this the Kabul
river emerged and took its course in a north-easterly
direction across the valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Approach to Kabul.</div>

<p>On the south bank of the river near the gorge
and at the foot of the Shere Derwaza lay the city.
Jutting out north-east from the Shere Derwaza into
the valley, about a mile south of the gorge, was the
spur of the Bala Hissar, and the city seemed, as it
were, to be tucked into the corner between the Shere
Derwaza, its Bala Hissar spur, and the Asmai
mountain. On our right, about a mile and a half
north of the city, was the Sherpur cantonment or
fortification, backed by two low hills&mdash;the Bemaru
heights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>We descended the elevated ground, from which
we had a birds-eye view of the valley, and found ourselves
riding along excellent roads fringed with
poplar trees. The cultivated fields separated by
irrigation channels lay to the left of us. On the right
were the pebbly hills we had crossed lower down, continued
irregularly west. On the last hill nearest the
town, “Siah Sang,” was a strong fort, built by the
British when Lord Roberts was in Kabul. It is
called Fort Roberts.</p>

<p>We rode along the avenues of poplar and plane
trees right up to the Bala Hissar spur. In the time
of the Amîr Shere Ali, on the high ground of the spur
stood the royal residence and the fort, and when
Yakoub was Amîr this was the Residency where
Cavagnari lived. It is now almost all in ruins or
demolished. The gateway stands, and a part of the
old palace. This is used as a prison for women,
political prisoners, Hazaras, and others. The wall
and the moat exist, and inside, some rough barracks
have been built for a few troops. The native fort
on the higher ground of the Bala Hissar seems to be
in good repair. I have never been inside. It is used
as a magazine for powder.</p>

<p>We passed the Bala Hissar, leaving it on our left,
and the road led through a plantation of willows
extending from the Bala Hissar some distance north,
skirting the east suburb of the city. The willows
in the plantation were arranged in rows about ten
yards apart with a water trench or ditch under each
row of trees, and the shaded space between was green
with grass&mdash;an unusual sight in Afghanistan. The
trees were planted by Amîr Shere Ali, whose idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was to camp his soldiers here in the summer without
tents. The willow branches are used now to make
charcoal for gunpowder.</p>

<p>We entered the gate of the city called the Lahore
Gate. It was rather dilapidated, but looked as
though it might once have been strong. There were
heavy wooden doors studded with iron, and large
loopholes in the upper brickwork of the gate which
were guarded by brick hoods open below, a species of
machicoulis gallery. Possibly the loopholes were once
used for the purpose of pouring boiling water on the
heads of an attacking enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Defences of Kabul.</div>

<p>The city of Kabul, 5,780 feet above the sea, lies then
at the foot of the bare and rocky mountains forming
the west boundary of the Kabul valley, just at the
triangular gorge made by the Kabul river. Through
this gorge runs the high road to Turkestan and
Ghuzni. An ancient brick wall, high, though somewhat
ruined, with towers at intervals, leads up on
each side of the gorge to the summit of the Asmai
and Shere Derwaza mountains, along the latter to the
Bala Hissar spur, where it joins the fort. From the
Asmai a line of hills extends west to the Paghman
range. Formerly the wall was taken across the gorge,
bridging the Kabul river. Remains of it are to be seen
on a small island in the middle. The city, therefore,
was well protected on the western side&mdash;the side of
danger from invasion of the Tartars: it is comparatively
unprotected on the east, except by the Bala
Hissar fort; for in those days little danger of invasion
was apprehended from India.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>The city extends a mile and a-half from east to
west, and one mile from north to south. Hemmed in
as it is by the mountains, there is no way of extending
it, except in a northerly direction towards the Sherpur
cantonment. It is here midway between the city and
Sherpur on the north side of the river that the Amîr
has built his palace.</p>

<p>His Highness speaks derisively of the founders of
his capital, “Dewanas,” he calls them, “Fools to build
a city of mud huts cramped into a corner among the
mountains.” One of his ambitions has been to build
a new Kabul in the fertile Chahardeh valley to the
west of the Shere Derwaza and Asmai mountains,
between them and the Paghman hills. Amîr Shere Ali
had also the intention of building a new Kabul, and
“Shere pur,” the “City of Shere Ali,” was begun.
However, he got no further than three sides of the
wall round it.</p>

<p>The desire to build a new Kabul is not surprising
when one has seen the present city. The first thing
that strikes you on entering it is the general look of
dilapidation and dirtiness. Closer acquaintance shows
you how inexpressibly unclean and unhealthy an
ancient Oriental city can become.</p>

<p>We rode through the narrow badly-paved streets,
and through the bazaars, which were crowded with
turbanned Afghans and Hindus robed in bright
colours. They moved out of the way of our rather
large cavalcade, but very few showed any appearance
of curiosity; and we rode on to the garden or orchard
in the gorge between the Shere Derwaza and Asmai
mountains, where, by the side of the Kabul river,
the Amîr’s European Arm foundry has been estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>lished.
This is protected on one side by the river,
on the three other sides by high walls.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival at the Arm Foundry.</div>

<p>The entrance was through a large double wooden
gate, where some soldiers were on guard. Inside
there were built along the walls a series of rooms
where tin workers, brass workers, and others practised
their handicraft. In one of the larger of these
rooms Mr. Pyne and myself were located, and an
adjoining one was prepared for the two English
engineers, Messrs. Stewart and Myddleton, who had
accompanied us.</p>

<p>In the centre of the ground three or four large
buildings were in course of erection. These had been
commenced by Mr. Pyne during his first short visit to
Kabul. The walls were nearly completed. To finish
them were the corrugated iron roofs which Mr. Pyne
had brought out from England, and the machinery,
some of which was lying around packed in cases in
two hundredweight pieces: the rest arrived on strings
of camels a few days or weeks after we did.</p>

<p>In our room we found a large table loaded with
sweets, cakes, kaimaghchai, or cream and tea, and
various other eatables. We set to, but were presently
visited and salaamed by some score or so of Hindustani
mistris, whom Mr. Pyne had engaged and sent on
from India. There was a very fair carpet on the
earth-beaten floor. Our beds, bedding, and chairs we
had brought with us. A soldier was posted on guard
at our door and another on the roof.</p>

<p>In the space inside the enclosure unoccupied by
buildings, there grew a great many mulberry trees,
and outside the walls were large beds of flowers, vines
trailed over upright poles, and a fountain. This plot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of ground had once been the garden of a wealthy
Afghan gentleman.</p>

<p>On the day after our arrival in Kabul it rained
hard, but on the following day we received a ceremonial
visit from Jan Mahomed Khan, the treasury
officer, who was accompanied by a large retinue of
servants. This gentleman was of medium height and
slightly built. He had a rather dark skin, but a very
pleasant face, and was charming in his manner. His
costume was brilliant. It consisted of a black
astrakhan hat of the globular Russian shape, a purple
velvet tunic embroidered with gold, a belt and
sword, both highly ornamented with beaten gold,
trousers and patent leather boots. The sword was
not of the European shape. It was made with a
slight curve, had no hand guard, and slipped almost
entirely into the scabbard. Mr. Pyne was acquainted
with this gentleman, having met him during his first
visit to Kabul. I, therefore, was introduced. After
the usual compliments and polite speeches, it was
intimated to us that Prince Habibullah, the eldest son
of the Amîr, would receive us at the Palace that day.</p>

<p>We learnt that His Highness the Amîr himself was
away in Turkestan, where he had been fighting his
rebellious cousin Ishak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Approach to the Palace.</div>

<p>After Jan Mahomed Khan had politely asked permission
to depart, we got ready to go to the Palace.
Our horses were brought to the door, and we rode,
accompanied by our guard and an interpreter, to the
Erg Palace. This Palace is situated outside the town,
about midway between it and the Sherpur cantonment.
We rode from the workshops some little
distance along the Kabul river, then skirted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Government buildings which are built on the south
and east sides of the Palace gardens, and arrived
at the east entrance, a big arched gateway in which,
however, there were no gates. Here we left our
horses. Entering the gateway we walked across the
gardens, the guard unceremoniously clearing out of
our way the clerks, pages, and petitioners who were
walking along the paths. We saw in front of us the
ramparts, moat, and bridges of the Palace. The
flame-shaped battlements of the walls, and the
decorated gateway set in a semicircular recess flanked
by bastions, had a quaint Oriental appearance.</p>

<p>On the wall over the gateway was a small cupola
sheltering what appeared to be a telescope, but may
have been a machine gun. From this tower issues at
sunrise and sunset the wild native music of drums and
horns, which is the invariable “Salaam i subh” and
“Salaam i shām” of Oriental kings. Many a morning
in after years was I woke up at daybreak by the
weird monotonous howl of the horns and the distant
rattle of the drums.</p>

<p>We crossed the bridge in front of us and entered
the decorated gateway, the wooden gates of which&mdash;massive
and studded with iron&mdash;were open. Inside
was the guard-room, large and high, with passages
leading off from it, and the soldiers of the guard were
grouped idly about.</p>

<p>The sentry on duty with fixed bayonet was
lounging in a wooden shelter near the gates. He
jumped up as we entered. We walked across the
guard-room, out into the open, and found ourselves in
another garden. On either side of the path were
grass lawns and trees. The paths were fenced off by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
thin iron railings. All around the gardens were
buildings symmetrically arranged: two stories high on
each side of the gateway, and one story elsewhere.
We walked along the centre path, till we came to a
long high wall, with loopholes extending across the
garden, and evidently concealing other buildings;
turned to the left till we came to a small heavy
wooden door studded with iron, and with the posts
and jambs somewhat elaborately carved. There was
no porch, but fixed in front of the doorway, about six
feet from it, was a high heavy wooden screen. The
object of this screen I could not see, unless it were to
obstruct the view when the door was opened. Near
the door was a wooden bench for the use of those who
were waiting. Between the door and the screen we
found an officer in uniform, armed with a sabre, and
several soldiers in uniform, all armed with Martini-Henry
carbines and sword-bayonets. We waited a
few minutes while the officer went in to report our
arrival.</p>

<p>We were admitted, and I saw, standing in the
middle of a flower garden, the Amîr’s pavilion.
There were roses, wallflowers, stocks, and other
sweet-smelling flowers in the garden, and the walks
between the flower-beds were paved with marble.
Directly opposite was the entrance to the pavilion,
and it struck me at once why the heavy screen had
been erected outside, opposite the gate of entry to
the garden; for the door of the pavilion being open
it was possible to see into the interior, and if the
door into the garden were also opened it would be
possible, without the screen, for a man in a distant
part of the outer gardens to fire a rifle straight up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the royal couch. On either side of the steps leading
up to the entrance of the pavilion reposed a marble
lion. These I found had not been carved in Afghanistan,
but were imported from India. The pavilion
struck one as an extraordinary piece of architecture
in an ornate style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Princes Habibullah and Nasrullah.</div>

<p>We went up the steps into the entry, where there
were several page boys waiting. They were not
dressed as Orientals, but had on astrakhan hats,
velvet tunics of different colours, embroidered with
gold, trousers, and English boots. The lobby led
into a circular or octagonal hall, with a high domed
roof, and, entering it, we found ourselves in the
presence of the Prince.</p>

<p>His Highness was seated in an arm-chair, his
brother, Sirdar Nasrullah Khan, on his left, and
several officers in a semicircle on his right. The
Prince Habibullah Khan is a broadly built somewhat
stout man, and appeared to be about twenty
years of age. He is fair for an Oriental, is shaven
except for a slight moustache, has handsome features,
and a very pleasant smile. Sirdar Nasrullah Khan,
who seemed about seventeen, is of a different type.
He is less broadly built than his elder brother, and
his features are more aquiline. Neither of the
Princes are tall. Habibullah Khan bears a strong
resemblance to the Amîr, though he has a smaller
frame and a much milder expression than his Royal
Father. The Prince stammers slightly in his speech,
and His Highness, the Amîr, told me this affection
first appeared after an attempt had been made to
poison the Prince when he was quite a child. The
Princes and the officers were dressed in European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
military uniforms, with astrakhan hats, and though
this was an Oriental court no one was seated on the
ground.</p>

<p>Contrary to Oriental etiquette we took off the
turbans which we had been wearing, for it seemed
better to act according to Western ideas of courtesy
than to attempt to imitate the customs of Orientals,
of which we then knew very little. We bowed as
we were introduced, and the Prince, without rising,
shook hands with us, politely enquiring if we were
well, and expressed a hope that we were not fatigued
by the journey to Kabul.</p>

<p>Chairs were placed for us in front of the Prince,
at some little distance, and to his left. Tea and
cigarettes were brought. The Prince spoke to us
for some time, chiefly about the machinery and
workshops. He spoke in Persian, the interpreter
translating.</p>

<p>There were four alcoves or rooms leading off
from the central hall of the pavilion, each about
twelve feet square: one constituted the lobby: in the
opposite alcove, I learnt afterwards, the Amîr’s couch
is usually placed, and one led off from each side.
The four rooms leading from the central hall were
not separated by doors, and over each was a corresponding
room upstairs, also looking into the
central hall, but protected by a wooden railing.
The rooms were lighted by windows opening into
the garden; and the central hall by borrowed light
from the rooms. The hall, though high and domed,
was not more than about eighteen feet across, and
against the four short walls that intervened between
the rooms, were placed respectively a piano with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
gold embroidered velvet cover; a carved wood
cabinet; a marble table covered with brass candlesticks
and ornamental lamps of different patterns,
from England and Russia; and a dark carved wood
escritoire with writing materials on it.</p>

<p>As I sat facing the Prince with my back to the
entry, I saw hanging on the walls opposite me two
framed chromo-lithographs&mdash;one representing the
English House of Commons and the other the
House of Lords. A year or two afterwards I became
much better acquainted with this pavilion, for I had
to live there while I was attending His Highness
during a severe illness. The Amîr told me he
designed it himself; I fancy he got the idea from
one of the churches in Tashkend, of which I have
seen a picture. It was small, he said, but was built
as an experiment; he had endeavoured to make it
earthquake proof by bracing it with iron bands. It
cost him a great sum of money.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earthquake.</div>

<p>The Prince lit a cigarette, and just as he began
smoking we heard a most curious noise. The lamps
and vases rattled violently, and I saw the Prince’s
face change. Pyne turned to me and said, “An
earthquake!” The rattling and shaking increased,
the doors swung open, and our chairs heaved. The
Prince sat a moment while the noise and shaking
grew more and more severe, then suddenly he rose
and walked rapidly out into the gardens. The whole
court, and we with them, followed hurriedly. All
thought the Palace would fall. With one exception
it was the most severe earthquake I ever experienced.
The shock lasted four minutes, and travelled from
east to west. We returned again to the pavilion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a short time, but presently were allowed to retire,
so that the reception ended somewhat abruptly.</p>

<p>As we were coming out I found there were two
other enclosures in the fort beside that containing
the Amîr’s pavilion. Next to the Amîr’s garden was
the large enclosure of the Harem serai. It is not
etiquette to walk past the door of this if you can
get to your destination any other way. I had to
enter this enclosure once, but that I will speak of
later.</p>

<p>Next to the Harem serai was a quadrangle containing
the official quarters of the Princes. Each Prince
has also an establishment in the city, where are his
servants, and horses, and his harem. Besides these
enclosures there is the Treasury, the Amîr’s private
Stores containing valuables of all kinds, silks and
diamonds, carpets, and wines: a row of cook houses
or kitchens: quarters for the court officials and pages;
and barracks for the garrison. The fort, though
seemingly strong, and no doubt useful in case of a
sudden riot, is completely under the control of the
fort on the summit of the Asmai mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Out-patient Hospital.</div>

<p>The next day Mr. Pyne set to work to get the
pieces of machinery removed from their cases and
put together. Followed by a sergeant and a couple
of soldiers of the guard he bustled about vigorously,
issuing rapid orders in a mixture of English and
broken Hindustani, and Persian, which compound
language his workmen soon learnt to understand.</p>

<p>I had received no orders as to attending patients,
but hearing from Pyne that there was a City Hospital
I rode off with my guard to see what it was like. I
found the Hospital was situated in the row of Government
buildings erected outside the Erg Palace on the
wide poplar-fringed road running between the city and
the Sherpur cantonment, which was made by the
British and called by them “The Old Mall.” These
buildings skirt the gardens outside the Erg Palace
on the south and east. Like most of the buildings
put up under the direction of the Amîr, they
are better built than most of the other houses in
Kabul. Though only of one story they are very lofty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with thick walls, and have glazed windows. The
buildings do not open into the street but into the
gardens, access to which is obtained by the big gateway
on the east side, where we left our horses when
we visited the Prince, and by a similar gateway on
the south.</p>

<p>In the storeroom of the Dispensary I found on the
shelves of glazed cupboards a great many cases of
old-fashioned surgical instruments, some of which
were marked “Hon. East India Co.,” and on other
shelves a large collection of European drugs in their
bottles, jars, and parcels. The name of each drug
was written in Persian as well as in English
characters. These had been ordered from time to
time by certain Hindustani Hospital assistants who
were in the service of the Amîr, and who had had
charge of the Out-patient Hospital and the European
drug stores. The Hospital assistants had not used any
great amount of judgment in their orders, nor had
they considered expense in the least. I found great
quantities of patent medicines warranted to cure every
disease under the sun; and of the newer and more
expensive drugs of which so much is expected and
so little is known. The old tried friends of the
Medical Profession, whose cost is reasonable and whose
action is known, such as quinine, ipecacuanha, carbonate
of ammonia, Epsom salts, were conspicuous
by their absence. I enquired what plan had been
adopted by the Hindustanis when they were making
out their orders, and learnt that they got hold of the
price list of some enterprising vendor which had
found its way to Kabul through India, and ticking
off any drugs or patent mixtures that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
promise an easy road to success in treatment, they
ordered great quantities of these, regardless of cost
and before they had tested them.</p>

<p>The stores were in charge of a Hindustani, who
had obtained a medical qualification in Lahore, and
who had been in the British service. He showed
me a medal, and was reported to be in receipt of
a small pension from the Government, though how
he received it while in Kabul I never heard.</p>

<p>I reached the Hospital about nine o’clock in the
morning, and found myself confronted by some eighty
sick Afghans who had heard of the arrival of a
“Feringhi doctor,” and were all eager to be cured by
him. In the time when Lord Roberts occupied Kabul
the regimental surgeons had done good work among
the Afghans.</p>

<p>A guard, with fixed bayonet, stood at the door
to keep off the crush; he did not use the bayonet,
but he used a stick that he had with some vigour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Patient.</div>

<p>Every patient who had a weapon, and most
Afghans wear one of some kind, was disarmed
before he entered the room. I had no interpreter,
and had been advised by Mr. Pyne not to learn
Persian; so that when the first patient was admitted
I was in somewhat of a difficulty. I had seen in a
Persian grammar that the word “Dard” meant
<i>pain</i>, so that when the first man came up I said,
“Dard?” putting a note of interrogation after it.
The patient looked blankly at me. I thought he
must be intellectually very dull, and I repeated my
word, but with no better result. Not knowing
quite what to say next, I examined him with the
stethoscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>He was greatly astonished, and shrank back somewhat
suspiciously when I placed it against his chest.
However, when he found no evil resulted, he allowed
me to proceed. I could not find anything the matter
with him, and was again at a standstill.</p>

<p>This seemed very unsatisfactory; when to my great
relief, a tall young man, in a turban and a brown
frock-shaped coat, stepped forward and addressed me
in imperfect English. I found he was an Armenian
Christian who had been educated in a Missionary
boarding school in India, but he had been so long in
Kabul that he had nearly forgotten English. He
afterwards became my interpreter, and grew very
fluent, but at first I had to learn <em>his</em> English before I
could understand him; it was quite different from
anybody else’s. However&mdash;about the patient&mdash;I said,
“Ask this man if he has any pain.” And then I
found that my word “Dard” ought to have been
pronounced more like “Dŭrrŭd.” I tried “Dŭrrŭd”
on them afterwards, but either they didn’t expect me
to know Persian, or else there ought to have been
some context to my word, for they looked just
as blankly at me as when I said “Dard.” The
ordinary Afghan is a very slow-witted person. I
found the patient had no pain, and I said,</p>

<p>“Tell him to put out his tongue.”</p>

<p>The patient appeared surprised, and looked somewhat
doubtfully at me. I suppose he thought I was
jesting in making such a request. However, he put
out his tongue: it was quite healthy. I said,</p>

<p>“There is nothing the matter with him;” but
the Armenian said,</p>

<p>“Sir, a little you stop&mdash;<em>I</em> find out.” He said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
something in Persian, and the man nodded. What
words the Armenian used to enable me to understand
what was wrong I do not remember, but I found out
eventually that the patient wanted a tonic, for all he
suffered from was an inability to manage his many
wives. I said, “Tell the man his complaint does not
exist in my country; I have no medicines for it.”</p>

<p>There were, I should think, a dozen who came the
first day for the same reason. Of other diseases,
malarial fevers, eye cases, venereal diseases, coughs and
dyspepsia were the commonest. I was not able to
finish attending to all the patients in the morning, and
returned in the afternoon, finding them still waiting.
As the days went by, the number of patients increased
to such an extent, that it finally became no small
matter to attend to them all, and do my own
dispensing. There were Hindustani dispensers, but
I was not quite prepared to trust them, till I
knew them better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Miraculous Recovery of the Page Boy.</div>

<p>One day a lad, one of the Court pages, was
brought: he was suffering from jaundice. I put the
suitable medicine in a bottle, placed it on the table,
then turned to examine another patient, mixed his
medicine, and put the bottle by the side of the first one.
I went on till I had about a dozen bottles ready, then
I ordered them to be filled with water, and gave them
out. The patients took their medicine and progressed
satisfactorily: the Page boy, in particular, rapidly
improved. I was naturally pleased and said so to the
Armenian. I thought he looked rather strangely at
me, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Truly God works for the Sir!”</p>

<p>I wondered rather that he should be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
impressive; but not for some months after did I
know why he was so. Then he told me. It
seemed that after I had mixed the Page boy’s
medicine and turned away to the second patient, one
of the dispensers seeing the bottle on the table ready,
as he thought, for use and not quite clean, washed it
out and replaced it. It was then filled with water
and the boy rapidly became well. The dispenser had
not dared to say what he had done, lest I should be
angry. There was great wonder and awe at the
hospital over that case, and my reputation as a healer
of the sick spread rapidly.</p>

<p>“If the Feringhi,” they said, “gives a pinch of
dust (jalap powder) or only water, the sick became
well!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Durbar Hall and Guest House.</div>

<p>In the Palace gardens outside the moat, and about
a hundred yards from the out-patient hospital, I saw a
large white building with pillared verandah and
corrugated iron roof. This was the “Salaam Khana”
or Hall of Audience. It is a long high hall, with
twelve lofty windows on each side draped with
English curtains: two rows of white pillars support
the ceiling, which is decorated in colours with
stencilled and lacquered plates of thin brass. The
floor is covered with English carpets, and when, as is
frequently the case, a dinner is given by His
Highness to the chief officers of his army, long tables
occupy the aisles, and each guest is accommodated
with a cane-seated wooden arm-chair. During a
banquet or festival, the hall is lit in the evening by
two big “arc” electric lamps, the dynamo of which is
worked by a portable engine, which is brought from
the workshop for the occasion. The building lies east<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and west, and is entered at the eastern extremity by
a big doorway and portico. The western extremity is
entered through a large vestibule with portico and
steps. Here the building is carried up another story,
and this part of the Salaam Khana constitutes the
Amîr’s Guest house.</p>

<p>On the ground floor are the great hall, the
vestibule or entrance hall which opens into the
Palace gardens, and three smaller rooms. A stone
staircase with wooden balustrades leads to the upper
floor. Here there is in the centre a large pavilion,
the Guest House, lighted by many large double
windows, which open on to the covered balcony or
terrace on the roof of the lower rooms. The Amîr
and, sometimes, Prince Habibullah, are accustomed to
spend a month or two in this house, living in the
upper pavilion, or in one of the lower rooms.</p>

<p>A few days after my first appearance at the
dispensary, I heard there was a military “In-patient”
hospital situated in the Sherpur cantonment, which
lies to the north of the town about a mile and a-half
away.</p>

<p>I determined to visit it, and one afternoon, after
finishing at the City dispensary, we started along
the Old Mall which leads from the town, past the
Erg Palace to the cantonment.</p>

<p>We passed first the Salaam Khana, and then,
further on, at the extremity of the Palace gardens, I
saw a small monument about twenty feet high. It
was square at the base and carried upward like the
spire of a church. On the square pediment was an
inscription in Persian. This monument I learnt
was erected by His Highness to the memory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
those soldiers who fell in the last war against the
British.</p>

<p>On the other side of the Old Mall, commencing
opposite the Palace and extending as far as the
monument, is a row of one storied buildings. These
open not on to the road, but on the other side into
vegetable gardens and fields at the back. This row
of buildings which turns a corner opposite the
monument and extends down a road running east to
the Kabul river, the Amîr has built as a barrack for
the soldiers of his body guard. About four feet from
the doors of this row of buildings is a narrow stream
of running water, artificially made and used, after
the Afghan custom, both for ablutionary and for
drinking purposes, as well as for the irrigation of the
vegetable gardens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sherpur Cantonment.</div>

<p>Proceeding on our way we approached the lofty
battlemented walls surrounding the Sherpur cantonment.
This oblong enclosure which lies nearly
east and west a mile and a-half due north of the
city, is a mile and a-half along its front, nearly
three-quarters of a mile along either end, and backs
upon two low hills about three hundred feet high,
the Bemaru heights, at the east base of which,
within the enclosure, lies the Bemaru village. The
hills protect the north side: the other three sides
are protected by the high walls, which are complete
except for half the length of the east extremity just
by the Bemaru village.</p>

<p>It was this cantonment, it will be remembered,
that was held by the British at the time when
Lord Roberts occupied Kabul during the second
Afghan war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The Afghans had planned a sudden night attack
in which their whole force was to move suddenly at
a given signal upon the cantonment. As Lord
Roberts’ force was exceedingly small, considering the
great extent of the cantonment, it was thought by
the Afghans that an easy victory would result. The
signal was to be the sudden lighting of a beacon on
the Asmai mountain. But there are never wanting
those among the Afghans who, for a sufficient bribe,
will reveal anything, and the British were ready
when the attack came. The rush was met by a
continuous and deadly fire, and after strenuous but
vain efforts to gain an entry, the Afghans retired,
leaving great numbers of their comrades dead on
the field.</p>

<p>The gate we entered was protected outside by a
semicircular curtain. Built along the inner side of
the wall were buildings one story high, with a massive
pillared colonnade or verandah and flat roof. There
were wood-faced, clay-beaten steps at intervals leading
to the roof, so that it was possible for troops
defending the cantonment to take their stand on the
roof and fire through the loopholes.</p>

<p>Just inside the gate was a bazaar of small shops,
where fruit, vegetables, and bread were for sale; and
soldiers in every style of dress, Turkoman, Kabuli,
Hazara, were grouped about. Some were seated
on the ground playing cards, some smoking the
chillim or hubble-bubble, others digging in little
vegetable or flower-gardens. These were created with
great pains around irregularly arranged huts which
formed the north side of the street leading along by
the colonnade. These huts and the rooms under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
colonnade were used as barracks. The soldiers seemed
to stare with more curiosity than the townspeople had
shown, and as we rode along towards the hospital one
suddenly stepped forward and seized my bridle. I
thought it was a piece of insolence, and raised my
riding-whip to cut him across the face, when it occurred
to me that perhaps it would be as well not to risk a
close acquaintance with the ready knife of an incensed
Afghan. My guard seized the man and hustled him
out of the way with many loud words, to which he
replied vigorously. Not understanding Persian, and
an interpreter not being with me, I could not enquire
what it was all about, so I rode on. All the centre of
the cantonment was a huge open gravelled space,
and here troops were drilling. The words of command
were in Afghani or Pushtu, not Persian, but the titles
of the officers were moulded upon English titles:
Sergeant was pronounced Surgeon; Captain, Kiftan;
General, Jinral; and there was Brigadier and
Brigadier-Jinral.</p>

<p>The hospital was in an enclosed garden within
the cantonment, and was entered by low but heavy
double gates. A series of rooms was built along the
inner side of the walls of the garden in the usual
Afghan style. There was no connection between
the rooms except by a verandah, and there was no
upper story. Each room was about eight feet by
ten, and as none of them had windows, but were
lighted simply by the door that opened on to the
verandah, they were nearly dark.</p>

<p>In the garden were a few trees, and in the centre a
square sunk tank for water: this, however, was empty.
There was a cook house or kitchen, with its coppers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and ovens heated by charcoal, where the cook baked
the bread and prepared the diets for the patients:
Pilau (rice and meat), kabob (small squares of meat
skewered on a stick and grilled over charcoal),
shôrbar, or broth, and shôla, which is rice boiled and
moistened with broth. There were two dispensaries,
one containing native drugs and one a few European
drugs. There were, of course, no female nurses:
each sick soldier was looked after by a comrade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Storekeepers and their Ways.</div>

<p>The Hakim on his daily round wrote on a slip of
paper the date and the name, diet and medicine of the
patient he prescribed for. This was handed to the
attendant of each patient, whose duty it was to procure
the medicine from the dispensary and the food from the
cook-house. I never heard of an attendant eating the
food intended for a patient. One hakim, the cook
and dispenser lived in the hospital. The slips of
paper were taken to the mirza, or clerk, who copied
the daily diets on to one paper and the medicines
on another. The papers were then put away in
the stores. No daily totals were taken, so that if
fraud were suspected on the part of a storekeeper,
dispenser, or cook, and the Amîr ordered a rendering
or auditing of accounts, the matter took a year, a
year and a-half, or two years before it was completed.
However, as I found later, the order in Afghanistan
to “render an account” is usually synonymous with
“fine, imprisonment, or death.”</p>

<p>The next morning at the out-patient hospital when
the Armenian interpreter appeared, I told him of the
soldier seizing my bridle in Sherpur, and asked him
to enquire what the man wanted. He seemed rather
startled when I told him, and at once turned to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
sergeant of the guard to enquire about it. It was
nothing after all, simply the man, guessing I was the
Feringhi doctor, wanted me to see a sick comrade.
They apologized for him, saying he was not a Kabuli
but an uncouth “hillman” who knew no better.
However, an order from Prince Habibullah arrived
in the afternoon that I was not to attend at Sherpur
till he had communicated with His Highness the
Amîr.</p>

<p>The same day that I attended the Hospital, I
received an order to visit a man of some importance,
the brother of the Prince’s Chief Secretary or Mirza.
Although it was but a very short distance, I went on
horseback, for I found it was not usual for any man
of position to walk about the town. The patient was
suffering from Paralysis agitans, or Shaking palsy,
and was of course incurable. I was not allowed to
depart until I had eaten some sweets and drank tea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Residential Streets.</div>

<p>To reach his house we rode through the streets
in which are the living houses of Kabul. I think
the most striking peculiarity of these Residential
streets is their narrowness, and the height and irregular
arrangement of the almost windowless walls.
Generally, they are simply narrow passages necessary
to obtain access to one, or a group, of
the living houses. Few of the streets, except the
bazaars, can be called in any sense thoroughfares.
They wind and twist about most irregularly, sometimes
open to the sky, sometimes covered in by rooms
belonging to the adjoining houses, and they usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
end abruptly at the closed door of a house or
garden. When one or more rooms are built over
the street the builder rarely trusts to the strength
of the original wall: he fixes wooden uprights on
each side to support the cross beams. Dirtiness
and want of ventilation are conspicuous. Drainage
and street scavenging are also conspicuous by their
absence. At one time it was exceedingly unsafe
to traverse the streets after nightfall&mdash;I mean for
the Kabulis themselves. Robbery and murder were
every night occurrences. It is now, however, less
dangerous. There are sentries belonging to the
military police posted at intervals, each having a
small oil lamp at his station. After ten o’clock at
night every passer-by must give the night word or
be kept by the police till the morning, when he is
brought before a magistrate to give a reason for his
wanderings. And the Amîr now punishes the crimes
of robbery and murder most severely. For robbery
and theft the hand of the criminal is amputated in
a rough and ready way. It is done in this manner.
The local butcher is called in. He knots a rope tightly
just above the wrist of the criminal, and with a short
sharp knife he severs the hand at the joint, plunging
the raw stump into boiling oil. Then the criminal
becomes a patient and is sent to the hospital to be
cured. No flap of skin has been made to cover
the end of the bone, and the skin has been scalded
for two inches or more by the oil, so that months
go by before the stump heals by cicatrization. A
priest one day&mdash;he may have been a humane Afghan&mdash;suggested
to the Amîr that operations of this
and other kinds on criminals should be done by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
European doctor. The Amîr negatived the suggestion
with a sharp reprimand.</p>

<p>For murder&mdash;hanging and other forms of putting
to death were found inadequate. So that now in
addition to the murderer being given into the hands
of the deceased’s friends for them to kill as they
please, such a fine is put upon his whole family&mdash;father,
brothers, uncles, and cousins&mdash;that they are
all ruined. Mere life is of no great value to an
Afghan, and at one time if a man found it inconvenient
to kill his enemy himself, he could easily get
someone who for six thousand rupees would do it for
him and take the risk of being hung, so long as the
money was paid to his family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Approach to the Kabul Dwelling-house.</div>

<p>Supposing you have to visit a person in the town,
you are conducted on horseback along the narrow
winding streets. You dismount at a door and stumble
into a dark winding passage with your head bent to
avoid a bang against an irregular beam, and you go
slowly for fear of puddles and holes which you
cannot see. You come into the open, and find yourself
in a garden with flowers and trees, and a tank
or pond in the middle, or in a small courtyard with
simply a well. The house is built round the garden
or yard, and consists of a series of rooms opening by
doors into one another and with the windows all
looking into the garden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Internal Arrangement of the House.</div>

<p>The richer men, especially those whose houses
have been built within the present reign, have large
and beautiful gardens full of fruit-trees and flowers,
and through them ripples a stream or channel
to supply the tank with fresh water. A house
so placed that a stream can be brought through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
garden from some irrigation canal is of greater
value than one where water can be obtained only
from a well. These modern houses are better built
and much more elaborate than the older ones. The
windows, large and often filled with coloured glass,
are made to open and shut on hinges. The floors,
though rarely boarded, are of beaten earth carefully
levelled. The rooms are decorated all round in the
Oriental way with “takchas,” or small niches having
the Saracenic arch. There is a frieze just below the
ceiling, and below this is a dado, with mouldings
which are arranged also around the takchas and the
fireplace, if one exists. The mouldings are of a
hard and fine cement with which the whole wall is
faced. The best cement is brown in colour, very
like Portland cement, and is found at Herat.
Generally the wall is whitewashed, and sometimes
before the cement is dry it is sprinkled with
sparkling particles of talc. The ceiling may be
boarded, but more often the beams are hidden by
crimson drapery stretched tightly across. In the
winter a crimson curtain is hung over the door. The
windows, except in the Amîr’s palace, are rarely
curtained.</p>

<p>The takchas or recesses are filled with vases,
lamps, or candlesticks, and the floor is covered with
beautiful Turkestan rugs or carpets. These, with the
addition of a velvet-covered mattress, properly constitute
the furniture of a room, for Orientals
habitually sit cross-legged on the ground. Now-a-days,
however, no rich Afghan townsman considers
his room furnished without a chair or two; not that
he uses them much except when a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
foreigner calls, but it is a sign that he knows what is
correct. Sometimes you even see a small table, but
this is not usual. The houses of the richer men
are in the suburbs. They cover large spaces of
ground and are rarely more than one story high.
They are not built level with the garden, but are
raised some three or four steps. The roof is flat,
and a staircase leads to the top. In the summer, on
account of the heat, it is usual for a tent to be erected
on the top of the house, and for the owner to sleep
there. There are apartments which are devoted
solely to the ladies of the harem, and also kitchens
and quarters for the servants and slaves. The stables
are, as a rule, in another enclosure. The whole house
and garden, surrounded by its high wall and entered
by only one gate, is absolutely private and screened
entirely from any curious eye.</p>

<p>Generally there is a room arranged apart from
the rest with its window opening outside and not
into the garden. This is often a story above the
others, and has a staircase of its own. It is for the
reception of male visitors who are not relatives or
intimate friends of the host.</p>

<p>The houses of the less rich, particularly those in
the heart of the town where space is limited, are
two, three, or even four stories high. They are
built on very much the same plan, though the garden
is replaced by a small cramped yard. Many of these
are very old houses, and their window sashes do not
hang on hinges, but consist of three shutters one
above the other, sometimes beautifully carved. If
the owner can afford glass the top shutter has one
small pane, the second, two, and the third, three;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
generally, however, there is no glass. The shutters
all push up out of the way, and the window is
generally wide open, for in the spring, summer, and
autumn, the heat is considerable. It is only in the
newest houses that you see fireplaces, and these are
rarely used, not because the winter is not cold, but
because wood is too expensive to burn in such an
extravagant way. There is coal in the country, but
it is not in use. Even if mines were worked it
would be far too costly a proceeding in the absence
of railways to bring the coal to town. Quite lately
a little inferior coal has been brought for use in the
Amîr’s workshops, but there is none for sale.</p>

<p>In the winter people keep themselves warm by
means of a charcoal brazier or sandali, which I will
describe presently. In the city, the houses being
crowded so close to one another, it was to me a source
of wonder how the owners could prevent themselves
being overlooked. I was informed that if a man
standing on the top of his house could see into his
neighbour’s enclosure, even into the garden, he was
compelled by law to build a wall or screen to cut
off his view: a violation of the privacy of a man’s
dwelling by looking over the wall is a great offence
in Afghanistan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Building of the House.</div>

<p>When a house is to be built, a trench two feet
deep is dug and large stones or pieces of rock,
unshaped, are packed in with a mixture of clay and
chopped straw. This is the foundation. The thickness
of the wall depends on the class of house and
the height it is to be built. Two feet is about the
thickness of the wall of a house one story high. In
the poorer houses the wall is built of lumps of clay or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
mud mixed with chopped straw: in the better houses,
of sun-dried bricks six inches square, an inch thick,
and laid on the flat: in the best, of similar bricks
properly baked. The roof is supported on beams of
unshaped poplar. The wood being of poor quality
the beams are arranged close together, with a space
of not more than two or three inches between each.
The beams are covered with rush matting, or, in some
houses, little pieces of wood, about four inches long
and an inch wide, are placed from beam to beam close
together. Over this or the matting is placed clay and
chopped straw to the thickness of eight or nine inches.
Upper floors are made in precisely the same way.
As there is very little rain in the country, a house
built in this manner will stand for years, but it is
necessary to repair the roof every autumn. When a
poor-class house is carried more than one story high,
the upper stories, often projecting beyond the lower,
are framed with wooden beams&mdash;poplar&mdash;and the
interspaces filled in with sun-dried bricks, making a
wall one brick thick. The builder never trusts to the
lower wall alone to support a second or third story,
but invariably fixes uprights of wood in the ground
against the wall to support the first floor. This may
be because the extra stories have been added on as the
need for more space became urgent. In the older
houses the walls are rarely perpendicular, but bulge
and lean in all sorts of dreadful ways. If a house
seems inclined to tumble over on one side, several
extra props of wood are fixed under it. Sometimes
an unusual amount of rain in the autumn will wash a
house down, and not infrequently an earthquake
will shake one to pieces. But considering how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are built, and what they look like, it is astonishing
how long they stand.</p>

<p>In the better class houses, built of brick, there
is not so much need of the wooden uprights,
though even in these you generally see them. The
walls of these better houses are some of them very
thick: this is the case when they are from the
commencement intended to be more than one story
high. The house that I lived in in Kabul, after I
returned from Turkestan, was one of the better
class. It was arranged in two wings at right
angles to one another, and was two stories high.
It was built of brick coated with mud and chopped
straw. The lower walls were about four feet thick
and the upper about two feet. Nevertheless, wooden
uprights supported the upper floor where I lived.
Below were the stables, the kitchen, and the
servants’ quarters. I noticed in the stable that
one of the walls bulged alarmingly, so that I did
not feel any too comfortable when an earthquake&mdash;a
common phenomenon in Kabul&mdash;shook the house.
The sensation produced by a slight earthquake is
somewhat similar to that produced when you are
standing on the platform of a small station and an
express comes rushing through. There is not so
much noise, but the shaking is very similar. A
severe earthquake is very different. It commences
mildly, and you think it will stop soon&mdash;but it does
not: it becomes worse and worse, the beams creak,
the windows and doors rattle, the house rocks, and
you wonder what is coming next. If it is daytime
you escape from the house; if it is night, and in
the winter, with three feet of snow outside, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
wait for further developments, hoping your house
will not fall on top of you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Warming of the House.</div>

<p>The houses, being built in this way with thick
non-conducting walls and roof, are wonderfully cool
in spite of the intense heat of the sun in summer.
They should be equally warm in the winter, but,
unfortunately, the windows and doors never fit
properly. There is no paint on the woodwork, for
paint is far too expensive to be used in such a
wholesale way, and the heat and dryness of the
summer make great cracks appear. Except in the
Amîr’s palaces there are no latches to the doors
such as we have. The doors and windows are
fastened by a chain which hooks on to a staple.
The windows of a room occupy nearly the whole of
the wall on the garden side of the room; and as
passages are rare&mdash;one room opening into another&mdash;there
are two or more doors to each room. The
number and variety of draughts, therefore, can be
imagined; so that with the thermometer at zero, or
below, it is utterly impossible to keep a room warm
with a wood fire in the fireplace&mdash;even if you have
a fireplace, which is unusual.</p>

<p>The Afghans do not attempt to keep the room
warm. They keep themselves warm, however, by
means of the “sandali.” An iron pot or brazier
is placed in the middle of the room and filled with
glowing charcoal. Among poorer people simply a
shallow hole is scraped in the earth of the floor,
and in this the charcoal is put. A large wooden
stool is placed over the charcoal and covered by
a very large cotton-wool quilt, or rezai. The people
sit on the ground round the sandali, pulling the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
quilt up to their chin. A big postîn over the
shoulders keeps the back warm, and the turban is
always kept on the head. In the winter there
is not much work done, and the people sit by
the sandali most of the day. Supposing you make
a call, you find them, masters and servants (all
men, of course), sitting round the sandali chatting
together or playing cards or chess. The ladies
have their own sandali in the harem&mdash;you don’t
see them. Everyone rises as you enter, and room
is politely made for you at the sandali. One of the
servants goes off to prepare tea, making the water
hot in the samovar. Another makes ready the
chillim, or hubble-bubble. The tray is brought in
with an embroidered teacloth over it, covering
teapot, cups and saucers, and sugar-basin. The
servant places the tray on the floor and kneels
down by the side of it, folding up the cloth for
a tea cosy. It is not etiquette for a servant to sit
crossed-legged in the presence of a visitor or a
superior. In the privacy of their own homes
etiquette is, however, considerably remitted. He
puts two or three big lumps of sugar into the cup
and pours out the tea, breaking up the sugar with
a spoon. He gets up and hands you the cup and
saucer with both hands. To use one hand would
be a rudeness. No milk or cream is drank with
the tea, except in the occasional cup of “kaimagh-chai.”</p>

<p>You must drink two cups of this sweet tea&mdash;it is
flavoured with cardamoms&mdash;and half a cup of tea
without any sugar&mdash;“chai-i-talkh”&mdash;this is to correct
the sweetness. If you make two or three calls in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
an afternoon, you feel it is as much as you can
bear. In Afghanistan you may call upon a man
whenever you like, but you must not leave his house
without asking permission. I told them that in my
country it was different: people were not allowed to
call upon us without invitation, and they could go
away as soon as they pleased. The Afghans seemed
to think this was very discourteous, for they are
nothing if not hospitable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bath House.</div>

<p>All the larger houses have rooms for the Afghan
bath; there is the bath-room proper, and a small
dressing-room. It is not a hot dry-air bath like the
Turkish bath, but a hot moist air, so that the heat
is never so great as in the Turkish bath. The
walls are cemented, and the floor either cemented
or paved with an inferior marble that is plentiful
near Kabul. The cement is made of equal parts of
wood-ashes and lime moistened and beaten together
for some days. In a recess in one wall is a cistern
or tank of stone or cement, with a fireplace beneath
it, which is fed from the stokehole outside the bath-room.
Public bath-rooms are quite an institution in
Afghanistan. They are rented by a bath-man or
barber, who makes what he can out of them. Some
of the bath-houses belong to the Amîr. The bath is
by no means an expensive luxury: the poorer people
pay about a halfpenny. Richer people who engage
the services of the bath-man or barber to shampoo
them, pay about eighteenpence. The plan I adopted
was to engage the bath-room and the shampooer for
the day. It cost but a few shillings.</p>

<p>Having sent word a day or two beforehand,
I used to start about ten o’clock in the morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
accompanied by all my Afghan servants, bringing
bath-towel, soap and comb. It is the custom
in Afghanistan when the master has engaged the
bath-room, for the Afghan servant to seize the
opportunity of having a free bath. Hindustani
servants in Kabul do not presume to accompany
the Sahib on such an occasion. The outside
appearance of the bath-house is not very inviting.
As a rule, there is a large pool of stagnant water
near by&mdash;the waste water of the bath&mdash;and you
dismount in a hesitating way. When you get
into the small dark unpaved entry, and slip about
on the mud, the inclination is to turn round and
go out again. However, having got so far, you
think you may as well face it out. You find
the dressing-room clean and dry, and the bath
proprietor (or tenant rather) comes out to receive
you. He is dressed&mdash;or undressed&mdash;ready to
shampoo you, his only garment being a waist-cloth.
The servants pull off your boots, and help
you to get ready, and then fix a waist-cloth,
which reaches the knees, very tightly round the
waist, fastening it with a particular twist. The
bath-man taking your hand, raises the curtain
over the arched door of the bath-room, and leads
you carefully in. The reason is that the floor
being very smooth and wet, you are exceedingly
likely, without great care, to have a dangerous fall.
When you enter, the air being damp as well as
hot, you feel almost suffocated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Process of the Bath.</div>

<p>A good class bath-room is generally octagonal,
with a vaulted and groined roof, not much
decorated, but displaying a certain amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
taste in the building. The windows are arched
and glazed, and very small, so that the room is
rather dark. The Afghan servants quickly follow
you in, attired in the same way as yourself, and
though they treat you with due respect, all seem for
the time, more or less, on an equality, and as they
dash the water over each other, they chat and laugh
quite unrestrainedly. The process of massage, or
shampooing, which the bath-men thoroughly understand,
is rather a long one; and it is not at all
uncommon when bathing to spend a great part of
the day&mdash;four or five hours&mdash;in the bath-room. For
myself, I found two hours quite as much as I wanted.
A cloth is folded up for a pillow, and you lie on a
warm part of the marble, or cement floor. You
generally see, at first with some disgust, a few large
long-legged ants, running quickly about near the
walls: afterwards you become indifferent, for, as the
bath-man says, they are harmless, they don’t sting.
There are such swarms of insects of all kinds
in the East, that you divide them roughly into
those that sting and those that don’t. The latter
you take no notice of, the former you treat with
more respect. The shampooer, having dashed on
a little warm water, begins by stretching and
kneading the skin of one arm, the rubbing being
done in the direction of the blood current; the
knuckles of the fingers he cracks with a sudden jerk.
Then he goes to the other arm. Having treated
all the limbs the same way, he places his two
hands on the sides of the chest, and suddenly
throws his whole weight on to them, which
stretches the skin, and compressing the ribs, drives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
out the air from the chest with a grunt and gasp.
Then he kneads and rubs the muscles of the
chest, shoulders, and body. After that he brings
you into sitting posture, and fixing you with his
knee, he seizes one shoulder and twists you round
as far as you can go, and with a sudden jerk in
the same direction he makes the back-bone crack.
A similar twisting is done the other way round.
He then takes a coarse flesh glove and proceeds
to rasp your skin off. The more he can get off,
the better pleased he is. They left me the first
time with a “fox bite” on the chest, which lasted
for days. On subsequent occasions I called attention
to the fact that I was an Englishman and not a cast-iron
Afghan. After the flesh glove, come two courses
of “soaping”&mdash;how it smarts! hot water being
dashed on at frequent intervals. The Afghan shoe
leaving a part of the instep exposed, the skin
becomes thick and coarse, and a piece of pumice
stone is used to scrub the feet with. This, after
all the rest, was too much for me, and I rebelled,
excusing myself by explaining that my life was of
value to the Amîr on account of the number of sick
poor in the city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lack of Ventilation.</div>

<p>Finally you stand up, and two or three
bucketfuls of hot water are thrown over your head.
Your servant then comes up, wraps you in a
bath-towel, and you go off to the dressing-room.
There are no velvet couches to lie on, so you
proceed to rub down and dress: then tea is brought,
you have a cigarette, and ride languidly home.
The Afghan bath is an excellent institution for
cleanliness in a hot climate, but it certainly is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
neither exhilarating nor stimulating. There is little
or no arrangement made for ventilating the bath-room,
and it is customary, in the bitter cold of a
Kabul winter, for poor people to obtain permission to
sleep there at night. It is a not uncommon
occurrence for one or two to be found suffocated
in the morning.</p>

<p>One day soon after I arrived in Kabul the Governor
of the city&mdash;the notorious Naib Mir Sultan&mdash;of
whom I shall have more to say later, sent to say
he was very ill. He had been suffering for days
from an agonizing toothache. I was advised not
to visit the Naib because he was not in favour with
the Prince. I therefore sent him some medicine
and directed the Armenian interpreter to go, and if
he found a decayed tooth to introduce a small pellet
of cotton wool soaked in creosote. A day or two
after, as I was returning from the hospital, I met
the Naib in one of the bazaars. He was surrounded
by a guard of the military police, whose Chief he
was, and by a great crowd of servants. At that
time he was execrated in Kabul. He did not, however,
look very evil. He had a dark skin but not a
disagreeable face. I enquired how he was, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
said the pain had entirely left him. He dismounted,
and I examined the tooth in the street. It was
decayed and the socket inflamed. I wanted to pull
it out there and then with my fingers, but he would
not let me touch it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Appearance of the Kabul Bazaars.</div>

<p>The bazaar in which I met the Naib is a modern
one built by the present Amîr, the street is wider
and the shops are better built than those of the other
bazaars.</p>

<p>There are three chief bazaars or streets of shops
in Kabul. Two lead from the direction of the workshop
gorge eastward through the town. One running
near the foot of the mountains to the Bala Hissar,
and the other near the middle of the town. These
two are for a considerable distance broader, better
paved, and more carefully roofed than the others.
In the best part the houses are two stories high.
They are flat topped, and beams supporting a roof
to the bazaar extend across from house to house.
In other parts, where the houses are but one story,
the bazaar is not roofed in. The other chief bazaar
extends from a strong wooden bridge over the
Kabul river, southward through the middle of the
town. This too is roofed over in a part of its course,
but it is neither so broad nor so carefully built as
the others. There are a few smaller bazaars and many
narrow streets or passages striking off in different
directions from the others. They are badly paved,
undrained, and exceedingly dirty. The shops are
small and open, like stalls, with no front window.
The floor of each is raised three or four feet above
the street, and the shopkeeper sits cross-legged
among his goods. At night he closes his shop with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
shutters, fastening the last shutter with a chain and
a curious cylindrical padlock. Some parts of the
bazaars are reserved for the sale or manufacture of
particular articles. There is, for instance, the shoe
bazaar. This is in the street leading from the wooden
bridge south. The Afghan shoes are of heavy make,
are sewn with strips of leather and have the pointed
toe turned upwards. Some are elaborately embroidered
with gold. The women’s shoes or slippers
are generally green in colour, and are made with a
high heel. They are almost sandals, having an upper
only at the toe. They are awkward things to walk in,
I have noticed, for they drop at the heel at every
step. The native shoes are those most on show,
but one can buy English boots of all kinds, from
the elaborate patent leather of Northampton to
the three-and-sixpenny army boot. There are also
long Russian boots made of beautifully soft leather:
these are the fashion among the highest class; and a
cheaper Turkoman boot of a similar shape with a
high heel that cavalry soldiers who can afford the
luxury invest in. A shopkeeper is, however, none
too ready to show you his best goods. He does
not exhibit them in the shop, for the Government
officials have a way of buying anything that
takes their fancy at their own price.</p>

<p>I noticed in the boot bazaar that in the three-foot
space under the floor of the shop the poorer men,
the cobblers, did their business. There was just
room to sit, and there the cobbler sat stitching, with
his nose on a level with the knees of the passers by.
A customer with a shoe to mend squats down beside
him and gives his orders. Cobblers who can’t afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to rent even such a “shop” as this, sit by the roadside
in the shade of a wall or a tree and carry on
their business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Copper Workers: Tinning of Copper Pots.</div>

<p>There is a copper bazaar. Though copper is found
in Afghanistan, most of that used comes from India.
This bazaar is in the street running east through the
middle of the city. Here, there is shop after shop
of men hammering out copper into the different
shaped utensils: the long necked vase for the
chillim, or hubble-bubble pipe: bowls and pots for
cooking kettles: water vases with long neck and
handle and tapering curved spout. The shapes are
all those made by their fathers and forefathers;
there is no new design invented. The pots used for
cooking are tinned over inside and out. Supposing
the tin has worn off your cooking pots, you send to
the bazaar for one of these men. It is interesting to
watch how he sets to work.</p>

<p>He brings a pair of hand-bellows with him and
a stick of tin. Settling himself on the ground in
the garden he digs a shallow hole six or seven
inches across. This is to be his furnace. From it
he leads a little trench about six inches long, which
he covers over with clay, placing his finger in the
trench as he moulds each piece of clay over it. Thus
he has a pipe leading to his furnace. The nozzle of
his bellows is fitted into the distal end of the pipe.
He begs a little lighted charcoal from the cook with
which to start his “furnace,” piles it over with black
charcoal, blows his bellows, and soon has what fire
he wants. A small boy with him having cleaned the
pots with mud and sand, he places the first one,
supported on three stones, over his furnace. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
it is at the proper heat he rubs it round with a rag
smeared with wood ashes, touches it with the stick
of tin, then rubs it round again with his wood ashes,
and the pot is tinned. If you are watching him he
may make it extra superfine with another touch of
tin and another rub with the wood ashes, and so he
goes on till he has finished them all.</p>

<div>Supposing the pot to be tinned is a large one,
the small boy, having thrown in the mud and
sand, stands inside the pot, and jerking it round
and round with his hands, cleans it with his bare
feet. Describing the way that the “furnace” is
made reminds me that I have seen men prepare an
impromptu tobacco pipe the same way. The
principle is exactly the same, only instead of
blowing air through the pipe they suck the smoke
from the tobacco which they have lit with a match.
To lie on your face on the ground in order to get a
smoke seems rather excessive, but if a man has
tobacco, a match, and cannot get a pipe, this is one
way out of the difficulty. I have also seen a soldier
use his bayonet for a pipe. He filled the cylindrical
part that fits on the muzzle of the rifle with tobacco,
and having put a lighted match on the top, he
fitted his two hands round the lower end and sucked
the smoke between them. Most Afghans are inveterate
smokers. The tobacco they smoke is not
the American tobacco that we have. It grows in
Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, and many parts of
Afghanistan, but the best comes from Persia. The
leaf is paler, apparently uncured and is not pressed,
nor cut, but simply broken up. I have smoked it, but
it is very hot in a short pipe. It smokes best in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
chillim.
<div class="sidenote">Tobacco Smoking by the Royal Family.</div>
The Amîr himself when he smokes, which
is not often, generally has a Turkish cigarette.
The eldest Prince, Habibullah, smokes cigars from
India. Prince Usuf, the Amîr’s uncle, one of the
younger sons of Amîr Dost Mahomed, smokes
American birdseye tobacco. He is a courtly old
gentleman, dresses exceedingly well, and is of the
bluest of the blue blood, and it strikes one as very
incongruous to see him puffing away at a short clay
pipe; he never smokes anything else.</div>

<p>There is the cotton and silk bazaar in the street
leading from the gorge to the Bala Hissar. The
shops here are mostly kept by Hindus. Every
Hindu in Kabul, and there is quite a colony of
them, has to pay a poll tax, and is not allowed to
wear a blue turban. It must be either yellow or
red&mdash;generally they wear red.</p>

<p>Besides the rolls of silk from India and Bokhara,
and the plain and printed cotton goods which come
from India, there are many English undergarments
to be seen: for English clothing of every kind is
very fashionable among the upper classes in Kabul.
There are cotton and merino vests, socks, and
handkerchiefs hanging on strings across the little
shops. The Hindu shopman in Kabul strikes one as
oppressively civil, he “salaams” so low with the
hand on the forehead. The Afghan trader does not.
You can buy or not as you please. If he has a
piece with a yard or two more than you want, often
he will not cut it for you. You can take the lot or
leave it, he is not particular. But Afghan and
Hindu alike ask you a much higher price than they
will afterwards take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>If you want to buy anything, you send for a
shopkeeper to your house and ask his price. He
tells you. You smile derisively, and offer him just
a third. He is pained, he is indignant, the thing
is absurd, he gave a great deal more than that
himself. You say, “Good morning.” Then he
says&mdash;Well, he will do what he can, for you are
a friend to the poor, but it will be a dead loss to
him; and he knocks a little off his price. You say,
“No,” but add a little on to yours, and so it
goes on for a variable time, derision and sarcasm
on your side&mdash;a pained indignation on his. Finally,
he takes less than half of what he asked originally,
and is well paid then; but when he goes away you
feel rather as if you had swindled the poor man.</p>

<p>Though shopkeepers in Kabul selling similar goods
tend to congregate in the same bazaar, they do not
do so to the same degree as in some of the towns
of India. You find boot shops in other streets than
the chief boot bazaar; and so with other goods for sale.</p>

<p>In the tea-drinking shops you see a large samovar,
about three feet high, in one corner, where water is
kept boiling hot by the glowing charcoal in the centre
pipe. Men drop in and seat themselves, cross-legged,
for a chat and a cup of tea. The shops will hold
some three or four. The Afghans like their tea very
hot, weak, very sweet, and flavoured with cardamoms,
which are put unpowdered into the teapot. They
pay a pice, that is a little less than a farthing, for a
cup of tea. If a man has some tea with him, and
he often has, he can always send to one of these shops
for a teapot and hot water. He pays a pice for it.
There is also a preparation they call “kaimagh-chai,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
but this is comparatively expensive, and is drunk
only at festivals or times of rejoicing. It is a
mixture of tea, sugar, cream, soda, and cardamoms.
It is thick, curdy, pink, and very sweet&mdash;not
at all bad to taste, but very “rich.” The teapots,
cups, and saucers in use are generally from Russia.
Some of the richer men have them from China or
Japan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kabul Restaurant.</div>

<p>Besides the tea-drinking shops there are the
eating-houses. These have no marble-topped tables
or velvet-covered chairs. The shop is the same as
any other shop, except that it looks rather dirtier,
probably from the amount of fat or oil used in the
cooking. The customer carries his lunch away
with him, or stands outside to eat it. The space
inside the shop is taken up by the cook and the
cooking pots. They sell kabobs&mdash;little cubes of
meat skewered on a long stick and grilled over
charcoal. A stick of kabobs, with some bread, is
uncommonly good if you are hungry; you tear the
meat off the stick with your fingers. They have
also meat, finely minced and mixed with fat, which
they squeeze in their hand round a thin stick and
cook over charcoal. It looks rather like sausage,
I don’t know what it is called. They use any kind
of meat for this&mdash;mutton&mdash;or, failing that, the flesh
of the camel or horse that age or infirmity has
rendered unfit for further service. There are many
kinds of pilau too. Rice, boiled skilfully till every
grain is soft without being soppy, is piled over the
meat, stewed to such tenderness that you can easily
tear a piece off with the fingers. There are chicken
pilau, mutton pilau, sweet pilau with raisins in it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and so on. Kourma is another dish&mdash;meat stewed
in small pieces and eaten with stewed fruit.</p>

<p>For his pudding the Afghan goes to another
shop, the confectioner’s. Here there are sweets
of many kinds: sugared almonds, “cocoa-nut ice,”
sweets made in the shape of rings, sticks, animals,
or men; gingerbread, soft puddings made of Indian
corn, much sweetened. In the summer different
kinds of iced sherbet, lemon, orange, or rose are sold
in the street.</p>

<p>In the bread shop, the baker squatting on
the floor kneads out the dough into large flat cakes
and claps it in his oven. The oven is a large clay
jar about three feet across and three feet deep,
with the neck a foot in diameter. This is buried beneath
the shop, the mouth being level with the floor,
and is packed round with earth. It is heated by
making a fire inside. When the heat is sufficient,
and the fire has burnt out, the baker puts his hand
in the mouth and flaps the flat doughy cake against
the wall of the oven, where it sticks. When baked,
it generally brings away some grains of charcoal
or grit with it. You pay two pice (a little less than
a halfpenny) for a cake of bread a foot and a-half
long, a foot wide, and an inch thick.</p>

<p>Flour is ground in a water mill. A hut is built
by the side of some stream which has a sufficient
fall. The water pours down a slanting trough
over the water wheel, and turns two circular flat
stones which are arranged horizontally in the hut.
The miller, squatting down, throws the grain into
an aperture in the upper wheel and scoops up the
flour as it is ground away from between the stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
on to the floor. The bread made from the flour
varies very much in grittiness, some is hardly at
all gritty. The Afghans are very particular about
eating their bread hot, they don’t care to eat it
cold unless they are on a journey. One of their
proverbs is, “Hot bread and cold water are the
bounteous gifts of God,” “Nan i gurrum wa ab i
khunuk Niamati Illahist.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Butcher’s Shop.</div>

<p>Butchers’ shops are not very common; meat is
an expensive luxury. Mutton is the usual meat eaten.
By very poor people other meats are sometimes eaten,
especially in the form of mince. In the latter case
it is impossible to say what the meat is, so the impecunious
Afghan assumes it to be mutton. If there
is any meat in the mince that is unclean&mdash;on the
shopkeeper’s head be it for selling anything “nujis”
to a True Believer.</p>

<p>There is very little meat to be seen hanging in
the shops, for the climate being a hot one and flies
numerous, the meat will not keep more than a few
hours. What the joints are it is impossible to say,
for they cut the sheep up quite differently from an
English butcher. At one time I used to try and
puzzle out when the joint came to the table what
it was: I gave up the attempt afterwards as futile.
The mutton is excellent in quality and very cheap.
I wished to give a dinner one day to a dozen Afghans&mdash;the
Amîr’s palanquin bearers. I bought a sheep
for 4s. 6d., some rice, butter, bread, and firewood,
and the whole cost less than 6s.</p>

<p>Kabul is famous all over Central Asia for the
manufacture of the postîn or sheepskin pelisse.
While riding along the bazaar running from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wooden bridge south, I used to wonder at one place
what the faint disagreeable smell was due to. I
found on enquiry that there was a manufactory of
postîns there. I have not seen the whole process
of tanning. The skin of the sheep or lamb with
the wool on it is cleaned and scraped, then soaked
in the river and pegged out in the sun to dry; afterwards
it is tanned yellow with pomegranate rind.
The leather is beautifully soft, and it is usually embroidered
artistically with yellow silk. The wool is,
of course, worn inside. The better ones are trimmed
at the collar and cuffs with astrakhan. There are
several different kinds of sheepskin postîns. The long
one reaching from shoulder to ankle, with ample
folds that you wrap yourself up in on a winter
night: there is nothing more cosy and warm to
sleep in. The sleeves are very long and are more
for ornament than use. These are but little embroidered,
they cost from fifteen to thirty rupees.
There is a short one with sleeves, which is elaborately
embroidered. This is worn in the winter by the
soldiers&mdash;cavalrymen, for instance, if they can afford
the necessary ten or fifteen rupees. Similar but
cheaper ones with less beautiful wool and no embroidery,
can be bought for four or five rupees.
There is the waistcoat postîn of lamb’s wool, which
is made without sleeves, this costs two rupees six
annas Kabuli, or half-a-crown English. These waistcoat
postîns and the long sleeping postîns are used by
all classes, rich and poor. The others are used only
by the poorer classes, the peasants and the soldiers.
A gentleman or a man of position would no more
think of putting one on, were it ever so beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and elaborate in its embroidery, than would a resident
of the west of London think of appearing in the
“pearlies” and velvet embroidered coat of the coster.
The rich men wear, in the winter, coats of cashmere,
velvet or cloth, lined with beautiful furs from Bokhara
and other parts of Asiatic Russia.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Furs: Their Cost.</div>

<p>The most valuable fur that is imported I have not
seen, only the Amîr wears it, and he rarely; from the
description they gave me I conclude it is sable. The
next most valuable is the “Khuz,” a species of Marten.
There are two kinds, the Khuz i Zulmati, which is
dark, and the Khuz i Mahtabi, which is much lighter
and of an inferior quality. These can be bought sewn
together in the sheet, either with or without the tails
of the animals attached. There were twenty-four
skins in the sheet I bought. The shopman asked £10
for it, but he let me have it the next day for £6.</p>

<p>Then there is the “Altai,” a beautiful fur taken
from the inner side of the leg of the red fox. A
sheet consists of many pieces, each with a deep
black centre surrounded by a dark red margin. I
bought one in Turkestan for £6, which I was told
was cheap. Squirrel fur made into the sheet, with or
without tails, either grey or grey and white, is very
popular. It is called “Sinjab,” and is less expensive
than the others. There are several other cheaper
furs&mdash;a white one they call cat skin&mdash;though of what
cat I do not know, the fur of it soon rubs off; and
a short brown fur, the name of which I never heard.
Astrakhan, of which the Amîr has the monopoly, is
exported largely to Russia and in small quantities to
India. It is used chiefly to cover the round or
straight-sided Russian hats that Afghan Colonels and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Captains wear. It is difficult to get hold of any in
the Kabul bazaars.</p>

<p>In the ironmongers’ shops are nails, hammers,
locks, knives, and horse-shoes. The last are made
broad, flat, and rather thin, in the Russian style. I
was told that this pattern is considered to protect the
frog of the horse’s foot from the numerous stones
and pebbles he has to go over on a journey. Shoes in
the English pattern are more expensive. I heard that
the Amîr had imposed a small tax on the sale of
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Weapons: Their Nature.</div>

<p>In the “arms” shops are swords, guns, and pistols
of various kinds. There is the curved “shamshir,”
or scimitar, with a cross hilt. Most of these
come, Mr. Pyne told me, from Birmingham, some, I
suppose, from Germany. They can be tied in a knot
if necessary. The Armenian interpreter one day
brought me a sword to examine; he was thinking of
buying it for eight rupees. It looked like an
English sword, and was brightly burnished. I put
the point on the ground and bent the sword to try
its spring. It seemed easy to bend. I raised it up
and it remained in the position to which I had
bent it.</p>

<p>“Wah!” said the Armenian, “and he is English
sword!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” I said, “German.”</p>

<p>Then I had to explain where Germany was.
But I don’t know, it may have been English; I
hope not. I advised him not to buy it for eight
rupees. He said, “I not have him at one pice.”</p>

<p>There is the straight-pointed Afghan sword, the
blade of which broadens to three inches at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
handle. The back from point to handle is straight
and thick. There is no handguard. The best of
these are made in Khost, a frontier district south of
the Kurram valley. The blades are often beautifully
damascened, and the handles of ivory or horn
are carved and inlaid with gold or silver or studded
with jewels. They are very sharp, the steel is of
good quality, and they are rather expensive. For
one of good quality without a scabbard, and which
was not elaborately ornamented, I gave sixty rupees.
I had a scabbard made in Kabul. The scabbard is
made of two long pieces of wood thinned and
hollowed out to receive the sword; these are
fastened together and covered with leather. Formerly
they were covered with snake skin. Mine
was covered with patent leather and mounted with
silver. I weighed out rupees to the silversmith,
and when the mounts were finished he weighed
them out to me before they were attached to the
scabbard. The scabbard is made longer than is
usual in England, for it takes the handle all but
about an inch, as well as the blade of the sword.
In these shops are also rifles for sale&mdash;the native
jezail with a curved stock ornamented with ivory,
and with a very long barrel fastened on with
many bands. The Afghan hillmen and the Hazaras
make these, and they are good shots with them.
They make their own powder also. There are old-fashioned
English rifles, flint locks and hammer
locks: some very heavy, with a two-pronged support
hinged on to the barrel, presumably to rest on the
ground and steady the rifle when taking aim;
native pistols and old English pistols of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
kinds; old shirts of chain mail and small shields
with bosses on. These are not used now except for
ornament. Lance or spear heads, old Indian and
English helmets, firemen’s helmets; powder flasks
made of metal or dried skin; and heavy tough very
strong wooden bows, with a straight handpiece in
the middle of the bow: these were used in the
time of Dost Mahomed. I never saw any arrows,
and the bows were sold merely as curiosities.
Boys and lads, now-a-days, use a bow with two
strings which are kept apart by a two-inch prop.
They use it to kill birds, shooting small stones
from a strip of leather attached to the two strings.</p>

<p>The silver and goldsmiths make native ornaments
similar to those one sees in India: broad, thin
perforated bracelets; studs for the nostril, that the
hillwomen wear&mdash;this custom, however, is not so
common as among the Hindus; necklaces of coins
and discs, amulet boxes, belt buckles, and so on.
Nothing original or peculiar to Afghanistan seems to
be made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turbans and Caps.</div>

<p>In the cap shops there are rows of small conical
caps, hanging on pegs and on bars across the top
of the shop. The Afghan turban is wound round
the cap which is jammed on the back of the head.
If put more forwards the weight of the turban
causes a painful pressure on the forehead.</p>

<p>There are several different kinds of caps. The
Kabul cap is thickly quilted with cotton-wool.
Inside, at the top, a little roll of paper enclosed in
silk is sewn. This is supposed to have a sentence
from the Koran written on it to protect the
wearer from harm. I opened a roll one day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
see what was written, but found the paper blank.
The best caps are embroidered all over with
gold thread from Benares. Some are but little
embroidered, have simply a star at the top, and
others not at all. Some are made of velvet,
and some of cloth. Those from Turkestan are
not quilted. They are not so heavy as the Kabul
caps, are of very bright colours, and are worn
indoors or at night. The caps are of all prices,
from three or four pice to fifteen rupees. The
lungis, or turbans, are also of many different kinds:
the commonest being cotton dyed blue with indigo&mdash;these
are of native make: or of white cotton or
muslin from India. A better kind are of blue
or grey cotton, embroidered at the ends with gold
thread, in wider or narrower bars, according to
the price. These come from Peshawur, and they
look very handsome on a tall dark-skinned Afghan.
Others are from Cashmere, most beautifully
embroidered, and are fawn-coloured, turquoise-blue,
black, green, or white. The ordinary length
of a lungi is nine yards; the cashmere, being
thicker, are not so long. The only white cashmere
lungi I ever saw was the Amîr’s. He gave it me
one day; but that is a story I will relate further on.</p>

<p>In the cap shops are also Kabul silk handkerchiefs
for sale. They are of beautiful colours&mdash;purple,
crimson, and green. I do not know what dyes
are used, but they are not fast, they wash out; and
the silk is of poor quality, not to be compared with
English or French silk. In these shops, too, are gold
brocades of various kinds, mostly from Delhi or Agra.
Some, however, are made in Kabul, the design being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
copied from English or European embroidery that has
been imported. Many of the workers imitate European
embroidery with wonderful exactness, though they
do not seem to be able to originate any new designs.
If one bolder than the rest attempts to do so, the
design is greatly wanting in beauty of outline.
The brocades are used for tea-cloths, and by the
Amîr and richer men for table-covers. The skill
of these men is also called into use to decorate
the dresses of ladies, and the tunics of pages
and gentlemen.</p>

<p>In the grocer’s shop the most prominent things
to be seen are the big loaves of white sugar from
India and Austria. The native sugar is made in
small conical loaves&mdash;about a pound each. It is
very sweet, but not so white as European sugar.
The loaves of native sugar are always wrapped
round with coloured paper&mdash;pink, red, or blue&mdash;so
that the shop looks quite smart. The tea for sale
is chiefly green tea from Bombay. It is brought by
koffla&mdash;camel and donkey caravan, from Peshawur
through the Khyber Pass, by the travelling merchants
or carriers. Many of the rich men of Kabul own
trains of camels, which they hire out for carrying
purposes. There is black tea also, but in small
quantities and expensive. It is said to be brought
from China through Asiatic Russia and Turkestan.
The Afghans always call black tea “chai-i-famîl.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lamps, Candles, and Soap.</div>

<p>The candles are of two kinds, tallow and composite.
The tallow are of native manufacture&mdash;dips&mdash;with
cotton wick. They are not used very much, as
they gutter and melt away very quickly. There is
a much better tallow candle made in Afghan Turkes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>tan,
thicker than the Kabul candle, which burns
exceedingly well. The composite candles are much
more popular, and are not very expensive. They
come from Bombay or Peshawur, and are used
largely by the Amîr and the richer men. The
poorer people use an oil lamp, very much the
shape of the old Roman lamp. It is of clay or
terra-cotta, saucer-shaped, with or without a handle,
and with a spout. The cotton wick floats in the
oil, and extends a quarter of an inch beyond the
spout, where it is lighted. The oil they use is, I
believe, almond oil: it is called “Têl-i-kûnjit.” It
has a smoky flame, and gives a poor light. Some
lamps on the same principle are larger, elaborately
made of brass, and hang by chains from the ceiling;
they have four or five wicks. Others, also with
three or four wicks, are made of tinned iron; they
stand on the ground supported on an upright about a
foot high. Paraffin oil from Bombay can also be
bought, and some of the richer men occasionally use
cheap paraffin lamps “made in Germany.”</p>

<p>Soap is both native and imported. The native
is in saucer-shaped lumps. It is not used for washing
the hands and face&mdash;an Afghan rarely uses soap
for this purpose; but for washing clothes or harness.
It is rather alkaline and caustic. A soap “plant,”
with its tanks, has been erected in the workshops,
and doubtless when the working of it is better
understood the soap will be of usable quality. At
present it does not sell. Other soap in the form
of tablets is imported from India, Russia, and Austria.
By what route it comes from Austria I do not know,
unless, like so many cheap German goods, it comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
through India. Russian soap is the cheapest and
worst, it crumbles up in your hands the second
time you use it. Next is the Austrian, which is not
at all bad; the best and most expensive is the English.
The native salt&mdash;powdered rock salt, pinkish in
colour&mdash;is not very good. You have to use so much
before you can taste it. I don’t think any salt is
imported. Spices of most kinds can be bought&mdash;pepper,
nutmeg, cloves, and so on; but these are
bought at drug shops.</p>

<p>Fruit shops are in great numbers, for fruit and
vegetables form important items in the diet of the
poorer people: in the summer fresh fruit and vegetables,
and in the winter dried fruits, particularly
the mulberry, are largely used. The fruit shops are,
as a rule, arranged very tastefully. Grapes of
different kinds are in great quantities and exceedingly
cheap&mdash;a donkey load for a rupee. Melons and water
melons, apples, quinces, pomegranates, pears, and
various kinds of plums, nectarines, peaches, and
apricots. Dried fruits, almonds, roasted peas, pistachio
nuts, dried mulberries, apricots, and raisins, are sold
by the grocers. Fresh fruit, as soon as it is ripe, and
even before, is eaten in large quantities, far more than
is good for the health of the people.</p>

<p>The Englishmen in Kabul had to be exceedingly
careful in eating fruit. Unless taken in very small
quantities it produced, or predisposed to, troublesome
bowel affections. The natives, though, as a rule, not
so susceptible as the English, were affected in the
same way, sometimes dangerously, occasionally
fatally.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tailors. “The Railway Guard” Costume.</div>

<p>In a tailor’s shop you see one man sitting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the ground hard at work with a sewing-machine,
another cutting out or stitching. There are no ready
made clothes in a tailor’s shop, these are to be bought
elsewhere. A rich man has, as a rule, a tailor attached
to his establishment. Those less rich having procured
their material send for a tailor from the
bazaar. He cuts out the material in front of the
employer and takes away the garment to his shop
to make up. This is a check upon the tailor, so that
there can be no purloining of material. Ready-made
clothes, new or secondhand, are for sale in many
shops. English coats of all kinds sell readily,
especially old military uniforms. One day a man
walked into the hospital evidently thinking himself
rather smart. For the moment I was startled: I
thought he was an Englishman. He was dressed in
the complete costume of a railway guard.</p>

<p>The costume of the hillmen and peasants is the
same as that worn by the Khyberi Pathans, which I
have described. An Afghan in typical native town
costume&mdash;say a mirza, or clerk&mdash;is dressed somewhat
more carefully than the Pathan. He wears the loose
oriental trousers, or pyjamas, gathered in at the waist
and hanging in multitudinous folds draping from the
hip to the inner side of the knee and ankle, the band
at the ankle fitting somewhat closely. The native
shoes with turned up pointed toes are worn without
socks, that is, unless the wearer is wealthy. The
embroidered camise, or shirt, falls over the pyjamas
nearly to the knee. A waistcoat with sleeves is worn
reaching a little below the waist and slit at the hip.
Finally, a loose robe or coat worn unfastened and with
long sleeves, reaches midway between the knee and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ankle. The waistcoat is of velvet or cloth, quilted and
generally embroidered with gold. The coat is of
thinner material, and, as a rule, of native cloth. The
townsmen, however, generally, though not always,
modify the native costume with European innovations.
As a rule the higher they rise in the social
scale the more Europeanized they become&mdash;in costume
if in little else. The Afghans, though invariably spoken
of as religious fanatics, are far less “conservative”
than the Mahomedans of India. You never see one of
the latter with an English hat on: a very great many
refuse to adopt even European boots. In Afghanistan
the readiness to become Europeanized, at any rate
in appearance, probably depends upon the personal
influence of the Amîr. After European weapons and
knives&mdash;these are readily adopted by all who can
afford them&mdash;the first thing taken is the belt with
a buckle, instead of the cummerbund or waistshawl.
It is, however, open to question whether this innovation
is an improvement, for in a climate with such
great variations of temperature as that of Afghanistan
the cummerbund is an excellent protection to the
abdominal organs. Socks are readily adopted even
by the conservative. Then come European coats,
which are worn by a great many of the townsmen.
After the coats, European boots. Trousers are worn,
as a rule, only by the upper classes, including the
court pages and by some of the soldiers. They are
made somewhat loosely and are worn over the
pyjamas. When a gentleman or Khan arrives at
home after the business of the day is finished, he
throws off his European garb and appears in native
costume. First, the belt and tunic are removed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
he dons the loose robe. Then his boots and trousers,
and he can curl his legs up under him once more
in the comfortable Oriental way, as he sits on his
carpet or cushions on the floor. To sit on a chair for
any length of time tires an Oriental very much more
than a European can realize.</p>

<p>Finally, English felt hats, or solar helmets, are
worn by the more liberal minded, or those who are
more ready to imitate the Amîr. Russian astrakhan
hats, semiglobular shape, and those wider at the
top, have been worn for many years by gentlemen
and officers in the army. This was not such a
striking innovation, for the somewhat similar Turkoman
hat of astrakhan has been familiar to the Afghan
for ages.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drugs.</div>

<p>In the drug shops are native drugs for sale. Some
few English drugs can be bought: quinine, of which
the Afghans are beginning to realize the value; and
chloral hydrate, of which some are beginning to
learn the fascination. The native drugs are such
as manna, camphor, castor oil, and purgative seeds
of various kinds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adventure in the Kabul River.</div>

<p>When we had been in Kabul about a fortnight,
His Highness the Amîr nearly lost the services of
Mr. Pyne. It occurred in this way. We were
riding along the lanes around Kabul, accompanied by
a guard of troopers, and Mr. Pyne was lamenting that
he had drank <em>water</em> for lunch. “There it was,” he
said, “still deadly chill.” He certainly had water
enough and to spare very shortly after. He had
galloped on a little ahead towards the river, and
when we turned the corner expecting to catch sight
of him, he was nowhere to be seen. The Kabul
river, swollen by rains and melting snow, was roaring
and foaming by. I galloped along the bank expecting
to see him. Hearing a shout, I looked back and saw
one of the sowars, who was some yards behind me,
jump off his horse and run to the bank, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
here some three or four feet above the river. I
sprang off my horse and ran up just in time to see
Pyne dragged out, dripping, by the lash of the
soldier’s whip.</p>

<p>He was galloping, he said, along the path on
the river bank when he came to a place where the
bank was lower and the river partly overflowed
it. Never thinking but what there was firm bottom
he did not stop, and down his horse sunk till
Pyne was up to his armpits in water, icy cold. The
next minute the current swept him off, and he found
himself under water near his horse’s heels, with
the animal striking out violently in its endeavour to
swim out. He came to the surface and tried to
swim to the bank, but his arm caught in the rein
and he and his horse were swept together to the
middle of the stream. He got clear of the rein by
sinking, and struck for the bank again, but found
the current turned his head up stream. Meanwhile,
his riding boots became filled with water, and his
turban and clothes soaked. The current swept him
along, but by violent exertion he reached the bank,
here four or five feet high, caught at a root and
shouted. The root was torn out, and again he was
swept into midstream: things now seemed to be
getting serious. He saw two men wrestling on the
bank, and a priest on a tower calling people to prayer,
but no one would look round at him. With the heavy
turban weighing him down, and wet clothes impeding
his action, he could with difficulty keep his head above
water. His breath was going, and his muscles
aching when he once more got under the bank. He
saw me go galloping by, and shouted. The sowar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
who was near heard the shout, saw him, jumped off
his horse, and threw him the lash of his whip.</p>

<p>Just under the bank his feet touched the bottom,
and he stood up to his neck in water, holding on to
the whip and panting to get enough breath to
scramble up the bank. He was hauled out, dripping,
and then we looked round for the horse. The poor
brute was struggling and snorting, and being rapidly
carried along midstream. Pyne ran along the bank
and called to him. The animal turned his head,
pricked up his ears, and struck vigorously for the
shore. He reached the bank, and with two or three
violent plunges scrambled up to dry land.</p>

<p>Pyne did not tell me all this on the river bank,
for we mounted at once and galloped off to the
workshops, so that he could get into dry clothes;
then I heard the whole story.</p>

<p>No evil resulted, but the soldiers of the guard
were informed that if Mr. Pyne had been drowned,
their lives would have been forfeited&mdash;a strong inducement
to a “guard” to be watchful and attentive.</p>

<p>I mentioned a “priest on a tower calling people
to prayer.” There are several towers round about
Kabul, mostly to the north-west of the city. They
are not of great height, and I doubt if they were
built originally for religious minarets, for they are not
attached to any mosque or musjid. Probably they
were originally watch-towers put up by the peasants
to guard their crops and herds from local marauders.
On the mountains near Kabul one sees stupendous
minars which were built, it is said, by Alexander to
mark the road through Afghanistan to India. One of
these may be seen from Kabul on the distant peak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a mountain to the east of the Kabul valley; another
can be seen west of Kabul, from the elevation of the
Paghman hills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mahomedan Mosques.</div>

<p>Mosques, or, as they are called, musjids, are
numerous in Kabul. Some are comparatively large,
with a courtyard and a domed roof with a minaret
on each side. These have either a stream of water
near, or a tank or well, for the use of those who
come to pray: for Mahomedans invariably wash hands,
feet, and face before they pray, and cleanse also the
nostrils and mouth. There is a rush matting on the
floor, and the worshippers leave their shoes outside, as
they do when entering any house. Inside, the musjid
is very empty and bare.</p>

<p>In the west wall is the niche, or mihrab, marking
the direction of Mecca: or the Kibla, so called
because of the Kibla or stone of Mahomed in
Mecca, and towards this the worshippers turn their
faces when they pray. In the larger musjids there
is also a pulpit or platform with three steps, called
a Mimbar, from which the Imām or preacher recites
his Sabbath oration, Friday being the Sabbath. The
Amîr’s new rupee is stamped on one side with a
decorative representation of a musjid with a three-stepped
pulpit inside. At early dawn, and at four
other times during the day, the priest mounts the
minaret, and, standing upright, with his thumbs in
his ears and his hands spread out, he utters in a
penetrating falsetto voice the call of the faithful to
prayer, “Allah akbar! Allah akbar, Mahomed
Ressul Allah!” and so on. “God is great, God is
great, Mahomed is the Prophet of God. Come to
Prayers, Prayers are better than sleep. Come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
salvation, God is great. There is no god but God.”
Then a few people begin to gather in, ten or twelve
to a musjid.</p>

<p>They stand in a row, their faces towards Mecca,
and the priest, having descended, stands in front of
them with his face in the same direction. The
priest recites the prayers, standing, or stooping with
his head bent, kneeling or prostrating himself with
his forehead touching the ground, according to the
law of the ceremony. The people imitate the priest
in his motions. They are supposed to repeat the
prayers to themselves, but the prayers are in
Arabic, which very few Afghans understand: so that
if they have learnt them by heart they repeat them
simply as a parrot does.</p>

<p>The smaller musjids have no courtyard, they are
flat-roofed and open on one side, the roof being
supported on that side by carved wooden pillars,
and the musjid is raised three steps above the street.
These have the mihrab, or altar, but no pulpit, and
the minaret is replaced by a block of stone about a
foot square outside the musjid, on which the priest
stands to utter the call to prayer. These, too, have
a stream, a well or tank, or some other water
supply for ablution.</p>

<p>So far as I could judge the majority of people
do not go to a musjid to pray except when there is
some national calamity, such as a visitation of
cholera. On these occasions they go in procession
with bands of music and flags. I once saw a procession
in the distance, but though I felt some
curiosity to see it nearer, I did not thrust myself
unduly forward. There are drawbacks to doing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
when Mahomedans are in a state of religious
enthusiasm, for there is the possibility that one of
them, overcome by excess of zeal, might obtain
Paradise for himself by putting a knife into a
Feringhi. It was not my ambition to be, in this
way, a stepping-stone to Paradise.</p>

<p>Ordinarily such Afghans as profess religion go
through the ceremony of prayer just where they
happen to be when the time of prayer arrives.
There are five periods appointed in the day. The
first, just before sunrise; the second, just after
midday; the third, an hour before, and the fourth,
just after sunset; and the fifth, when they can
no longer distinguish a white from a black thread.
If they happen to be at Durbar they withdraw a
little from the presence of the Amîr&mdash;for His
Highness sits towards the west of the audience
chamber&mdash;spread their cloaks or coats in lieu of
“praying carpets,” and turning towards the west,
or Mecca, go through their prayers. The Amîr’s
two eldest sons pray regularly at the appointed
times, and if they happen to be in Durbar at the
time some of the chief officers join them.</p>

<p>His Highness the Amîr does not pray, at least
so far as I know. I have never seen him do so
openly, though it may be he prays in his heart. I
have noticed that some of the greatest scoundrels at
the Court are those who openly pray, or go through
the form of prayer most regularly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afghan Conception of God.</div>

<p>God, as conceived by the Afghans, seems to
be an All-powerful Being, towards whom it is
necessary to behave with the greatest politeness;
for if one detail of etiquette be omitted God will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
offended&mdash;and then what harm He can bring upon
the offender! It is far less dangerous to offend
against a fellow-man by annexing his property or
taking his life than to insult God by omitting to
bow down to Him on one of the five appointed
times.</p>

<p>There are many, however, who do not trouble
to be religious. I do not know how they look at
things: whether they think too much is required
of them, or that they will probably be able to gain
Paradise in the end by killing some unbelievers, or
whether they simply don’t care. When attending
medically any man of education, I had always to be
careful in enquiring whether he were “religious” or
not; for if I gave a tincture (containing spirit) to
any “religious” man, I got into trouble&mdash;he evidently
considered that I wished to injure his prestige with
God. With the uneducated, or poorer people, I had
no trouble of that kind. They swallowed anything
I liked to give them unhesitatingly. I never found
the “religious” Afghan a whit less ready to “do
his neighbour in the eye” than a non-religious one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Languages Learnt in Afghanistan.</div>

<p>The musjid is also the schoolhouse, and is presided
over by the priest. A learned priest will get a
good many pupils, but an unlearned one none. I have
often seen boys from eight to thirteen years of age
seated in a row in the musjid with the moolah, or
priest, opposite them. Their open books are propped
on an <b>X</b> shaped support, and the boys sway backwards
and forwards as they drone out in a monotonous
voice whatever they are committing to memory.
The education of the majority seems to be of the
very slenderest. They learn to read parts of certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
books and to write a little. With some, education
is carried further, particularly among those who are
intended for priests and mîrzas. Some of the latter
study Persian sufficiently to write a well worded
and flowery letter: they learn, too, a certain amount
of mathematics&mdash;arithmetic and Euclid. The moolahs
learn some Arabic because the Koran is written in
that language: otherwise, foreign languages are not
taught. The Court pages seem to be taught rather
more than other boys; some of them learn the different
languages of the country&mdash;Pushtu and Turki&mdash;as well
as Persian. The Amîr’s eldest son, Prince Habibullah,
was learning English when I was in Kabul, though I
never heard of anyone else learning the language. I
have heard the Amîr speak Persian, Pushtu, and
Turki. He told me he could speak Arabic also. Of
Russian he said he knew two words only, I have
forgotten what they were; and of English he knew
two words: “tree,” he said, meant “dirakht,” and
“gown” meant a lady’s dress.</p>

<p>The income of the priests is derived from their
fees for performing the ceremonies of marriage
and of burial, and from charitable donations.</p>

<p>A priest who is a Sêyid, or a direct descendant
of the Prophet, is hereditarily a beggar. He can
demand from anyone he pleases a sufficient sum of
money for his wants. The Sêyids in Afghanistan do
not seem to have the exclusive right of wearing green
turbans: in fact, I never saw one with a green turban
on, though I have often seen page boys and others
not Sêyids wearing them. One of my servants, the
mîrza, or secretary, was a Sêyid. He was a good sort
of man in his way, and I quite liked him. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
he used to smoke Churrus, or Indian hemp, and it
affected his intellect. At times he behaved like one
insane. He never attempted any violence towards
me; in fact, though I was warned against him, I
think he was too attached to me to do me an injury:
but, perhaps, I am wrong in this; however, he never
did do any harm. If he were upset he would cover
his face with chalk and walk about shaking his
head in a dejected way, muttering, “Tobah, tobah,”
Alas! alas! One day he removed all his clothing,
and went out into the street with his beggar’s wallet
only. I sent one of the military police to fetch him
back, and asked him if he were not ashamed to
behave in that manner. He said he was tired of work.
I said, “You are earning an honest living and are
able to send money to your wife and children in
Jelalabad.” He said, Yes, but he had to write
when he didn’t want to write. It was better that
he should go out with nothing and beg for his few
wants. As for his wife and children, God would
take care of them. There seemed a certain amount
of “method” in this. Occasionally, however, he was
very violent, though not with me, and I could hear
him raving like a madman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hafiz who was Fined.</div>

<p>One of the compounders at the hospital was a
Hafiz and a moolah; a Hafiz is one who from memory
can repeat the whole Koran. He was a tall handsome
young man with courtly manners. He lived at my
house, and at daybreak I was often dreamily roused
by his fine tenor voice as he was chanting his prayers.
Once his early prayer was of considerable worldly
service to me and the neighbourhood, for he found
that the bathroom of my house was on fire; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
beams were already alight. He summoned assistance,
the fire was soon put out and the matter ended. If
the house had been burnt the affair would have
reached the ears of the authorities, and the neighbours
would have had a fine imposed upon them unless they
could produce the incendiary! This young man had
asked permission to live at my house because he could
do so cheaply. He was saving money to pay off a
debt incurred in Peshawur, his native town. I
thought, What an honest worthy young man! but
I found the money had been borrowed to pay off a
fine imposed upon him for a murder he committed
in Peshawur. He escaped hanging because there
was an element of doubt in the case, and possibly
for the reason that his elder brother had been some
years in the British service. He admitted to me
that he had stabbed the man, but he did not regret
it. The man was a “bad man” and had injured him.</p>

<p>“Surely the Koran does not tell you to commit
murder,” I said.</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “the Koran is God’s book, but we
are all sinners.”</p>

<p>One of the hospital assistants, a Hindostani,
working under me, was also a Hafiz and a priest.
He was a very gentlemanly man of about forty-six,
and well educated. He had been in the Bengal
cavalry. I liked him very much, but, unlike most
Mahomedans, he was a dipsomaniac. For a fortnight
or so he would be miserably drunk. He drank the
native spirit made from raisins, methylated spirit, or
any kind of intoxicant he could get hold of. He
explained his condition to me by saying that
“Shâitan” came to him occasionally and said, “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
have drunk no shrâb for so long, now is a very good
time to drink,” and so he listened to Shâitan and
drank. He afterwards gave up alcohol and took to
chloral eating and opium smoking. I was very sorry
for the man. I think he was not such a scoundrel
as some of them.</p>

<p>When I first entered the service I picked up a
man in Kabul who could speak a little English, and
had him to look after my clothes and wait upon me&mdash;my
valet. He was a short thick-set man, with
a shaven head, on which he always perched a little
red fez. He was wonderfully gentle with sick
children, who were brought to me to prescribe for.
He was very lazy, but was cowed at once if I were
angry. I found he was a hired assassin who had
escaped from Peshawur into Afghanistan. When I
discharged him he made a large sum of money by
gambling in the bazaar, and then returned to
Peshawur. The last I heard of him was that he
had been apprehended and was in jail.</p>

<p>At one time, after I returned from Turkestan,
I used often to go and dine at the workshops with
the other Englishmen, and two of the military police
who guarded my house came at ten o’clock with
a lantern to escort me home. My interpreter did
not like my doing this at all, because I had to ride
through some narrow winding streets and across the
large orchard or garden before I reached the shops.
He said, “It is known that you often come home
at that time of night, and you might easily be shot,
and there be no possibility of finding the man who
fired at you. In that case your guard would be killed,
and probably I as well for not warning you.” How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>ever,
it was too depressing to be always alone, and
no one ever shot at me. One of these soldiers who
came for me was a big, very handsome man, but he
had a curious furtive look in his eyes. He used to
pull my riding-boots off when I got home, and put
out the candle. I remarked once upon the curious
look in his eyes, and was told that all in his particular
profession had that look.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Strangler as a Valet.</div>

<p>I enquired what he did besides guarding my house.
They said, “Have you not noticed that on some nights
another man takes his place?” I had noticed it.
I was then informed that he was one of the official
executioners, whose duty it was to strangle certain
of the prisoners in jail. The unfortunate is told one
day that he will have the privilege that night of
sleeping in a separate room. He is conducted there,
and finds there is one other occupant of the room.
As soon as he is asleep the other occupant&mdash;my
friend!&mdash;secretly placing a noose round the neck of
the sleeper, suddenly draws it tight and throws his
whole weight upon the chest, striking the victim
violently over the heart.</p>

<p>The late Governor of Kabul and chief of the police,
Naib Mir Sultan, whom the Amîr hanged recently for
his iniquities, largely employed this means of getting
rid of prisoners. An anxious woman would come
to him with perhaps a thousand rupees, and implore
his intercession on behalf of her husband who was
in jail. The Naib would say, “Yes, he would do
what he could, he knew the case was coming on
directly, but it was an expensive business; if she
could bring another thousand perhaps the thing could
be done.” And he would keep her dangling on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
some time, squeezing out of her all the money he
could get, and then she would be informed officially
that her husband had died in jail of an illness!</p>

<p>Sometimes a prisoner who was sick would ask
permission to see the doctor, and he would be
brought to me at the hospital with chains round
his ankles, in charge of a soldier with fixed
bayonet. But I was very careful about prescribing
for a prisoner, for the Naib was an adept in the
use of poisons as well as of stranglers, and a death
might be imputed to me. Another way he had of
removing objectionable men who were not prisoners.
Some night two of the police knock loudly at a
man’s door, saying, “Get up at once, Amîr Sahib
calls you.” This is quite likely to be true, for His
Highness often continues at his work late into the
night, and the man hurries on his clothes and goes
out with the police. He is never seen again; but
some days afterwards his head is found in one place
and his body in another. Then the widow in great
distress goes before the Amîr and tells her story.</p>

<p>The Amîr naturally enquires, “Who is your
husband?” The woman explains, saying, “Amîr
Sahib sent for him on such and such a night.” The
Amîr, of course, tells her that he did not, and
enquires if she can identify the soldiers who came
for her husband. She cannot, for it being night and
she a woman, she has never seen them. The natural
conclusion is that some enemies of her husband have
personated soldiers and murdered him.</p>

<p>I have, however, heard other explanations of
these incidents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The End of the Naib.</div>

<p>The Naib was not a bad-looking man: he had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
dark skin, but rather an agreeable expression than
otherwise. He never dared go out without a large
guard of his police, the townspeople would have
torn him to pieces. Prince Habibullah disliked him
even when I first entered the service in 1889, and,
finally, his iniquities were proven to the Amîr. I
forget what the particular charge against him was,
but he was fined, they said, a hundred lacs of rupees
to begin with, somewhere about half a million! He
paid it, and another fine was imposed which necessitated
his selling up everything. Brought before
the Amîr soon after this, he was insolent, and His
Highness in exasperation seized him by the beard and
struck him in the face. The soldiers then hurried
him away to a tree outside. Someone suggested his
praying. “Pray!” he said, with a laugh, “after a life
like mine? No, I’ll die as I have lived;” and they
hanged him on the tree.</p>

<p>This is the story as I heard it at the time. I did
not see him hanged, for there was a cholera epidemic
in Kabul, and I was there. The Amîr was at Paghman
in the mountains.</p>

<p>Though Friday is the Sabbath, the shops are
open on that day as well as on other days in the
week. Somewhat less work is done, especially at
the time of the priests’ oration in the principal
musjids, about two in the afternoon. In Kabul the
Amîr’s workshops are closed, and the Out-patient
Hospital also. The Amîr himself, too, does less work
on that day, otherwise there is no great difference
between the Sabbath and other days in the week.</p>

<p>I spoke just now of fees to a priest for a
“burial” service, but, perhaps, that is hardly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
correct term to apply, for I never saw any service
or ceremony performed at the actual time of burial.
However, it is possible there may be, though I never
saw one, but I have seen the service performed at a
death bed.</p>

<p>When I was in Turkestan a young officer, a
cousin of the Sultana’s, was ill. The Hakims, who
were attending him, not knowing the use of the
stethoscope, could not diagnose the case, and after
some days I was sent for. I found that he had had
Pneumonia, or Inflammation of the lung, and that
instead of clearing up, the inflamed lung had become
tubercular, and a cavity could be detected in it. He
had developed consumption. I did what I could, but
it was too late for any permanent relief to be
afforded him.</p>

<p>He became worse, and one day when I called,
he was manifestly dying. I found several men
sitting on the ground by the bedside reciting prayers
continuously. I enquired why they were doing so
at this time, and was told they would continue
praying till he died, for he was then passing to
Paradise over the narrow bridge whose edge was
sharper than a razor, and that the continuous
prayers kept away the evil spirits who were
endeavouring to drag him down into the abyss.</p>

<p>The men praying were his nearest relations, and
with them was a priest; for although it is the
Mahomedan custom for the nearest relatives to
recite the prayers on this occasion, a priest is
generally sent for also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Royal Tombs.</div>

<p>The graves of the richer Afghans have upright
headstones of marble or slate carefully shaped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ornamented. The writing on them is in relief, the
stone being chipped away from the letters. The
tomb of an illustrious man is bricked round, about
two feet high, and covered with a slab of marble.
Occasionally one is surrounded by a fence: trees and
flowers being planted in the enclosure. The grave
of the Amîr’s father near Kabul is cared for in this
way. Others have a sort of small mosque or musjid
built over them; and the deceased, when his name is
forgotten, becomes a holy man and a saint.</p>

<p>The grave of a poor man has a flat stone, the
largest his friends can find, planted upright to mark
the place of burial: many have no mark at all, but
the collection of mounds is not to be mistaken. The
graveyard is not walled in or enclosed. The tombs
of the kings are, some of them, imposing. That of
Timour Shah in Kabul (son of Ahmed Shah, founder
of the Durani Empire) is a very fine piece of brickwork.
A huge central dome is surrounded by a
series of flat-roofed rooms, the ground plan of the
structure being octagonal. No care is taken of it,
and it is becoming dilapidated by time. The tomb of
Babur Shah, just outside Kabul, is also becoming
dilapidated. It is smaller and of marble, in the style
of the smaller musjids, with pillars to support the
roof. Another tomb just outside Kabul is built in
the shape of a musjid. It is that of a grandson of
Amîr Dost Mahomed. I knew his son very well,
Sirdar Abdul Kûdus Khan. The latter once was of
great service to the Amîr. In one engagement, by a
brilliant charge, he completely turned the fortunes of
the day. Success was too much for him, and he
became presumptuous. He was accordingly ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
into honourable confinement. Some time afterwards
he was allowed to appear at court, but for many
years no appointment was given to him. Quite
recently, he received office, being made Governor of
the province of Bamian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Proposal of Marriage.</div>

<p>The marriage ceremony differs very much from
ours in England. Firstly, the young Afghan does not
see his sweetheart till she becomes his wife&mdash;at any
rate he is not supposed to. He hears that such a
man has a very pretty daughter, and that she is
likely to have so much dowry. He therefore sends
his mother or sisters on a visit to the harem. The
ladies, properly veiled, are conducted there by their
servants in a closed palanquin. On their return they
give their opinion, and all the information they have
managed to glean. If everything is satisfactory to
the young man, he approaches the father or guardian,
and makes his proposal. If he is accepted as a suitor,
an opportunity is given to the young lady to see the
swain herself, unobserved. She can, if she like,
refuse him, and if she be a girl of strong character,
may be successful in her refusal: but I know that
sometimes considerable pressure is brought to bear, if
her wishes are contrary to those of her father or
guardian. Sometimes the young man, if he holds a
subordinate position, will prevail upon his superior
officer to make the proposal for him to the father
or guardian. It may have more weight. I once
had this onerous and pleasing duty to perform.
I marshalled all my servants, and rode off with as
much ceremony as possible, to the house of the young
lady. I had a vague sort of an idea I might see her;
but I did not: she saw me, which was not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
satisfactory. When I arrived at the house, I was
conducted through the courtyard into an upstairs
room, where the guardian&mdash;her brother in this case&mdash;received
me. A party of gentlemen were in the
room, and they all rose as I entered. After the usual
salutations a chair was offered me: the rest seated
themselves cross-legged round the room. I made a
formal proposal in the name of my subordinate, and
a discussion followed. I was surprised at the free
and open way in which they said the man for whom
I was making the proposal was a rascal and a liar,
and that he had not the money he said he had. There
was no delicate hinting that, perhaps, they had erred
in assuming his fortune was such and such. I
naturally anticipated a refusal; no, out of respect for
me, he was accepted! Then a large tray of loaf
sugar broken into pieces was brought in, and first
I and the guardian, then the others, ate a little,
and the rest was given to the servants. After that
we had tea, and I rode off home again, where the
anxious lover was waiting for me. I said,</p>

<p>“They called you very bad names.”</p>

<p>“That matters little;” said he, “did you eat
the sugar?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said.</p>

<p>“Ah! then all is well! the other is a custom.”</p>

<p>The actual ceremony of marriage is performed
at the house of the bridegroom, though there is
often a reception at the bride’s house afterwards&mdash;not
that you see the bride or any other ladies. The
father, guardian, or brothers receive you.</p>

<p>At the marriage ceremony the amount of dower
is first discussed and settled, and then the priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
formally enquires, first of the bridegroom then of the
bride’s legal representative, whether they each agree
to the marriage. On receiving an answer in the
affirmative he pronounces a few short prayers and
blessings, remaining seated while he does so, and the
ceremony is concluded; sometimes, also, rings are
exchanged. Then comes the reception of guests
at the bride’s house.</p>

<p>I was invited to the wedding of Prince
Habibullah. I did not see the ceremony, where
the priest blesses the union, but I attended the
reception at the house of the bride’s father. It
happened to be in the suburbs, near where I was
living, and I walked there escorted by my servants
and guard. I was shown into a large flower-garden
where several tents were erected. A great
many guests had arrived, but not the Prince.
Presently, I heard the “Salaam-i-Padshah”&mdash;the
representative of our National Anthem&mdash;being played
by a brass band. It is a solemn and slow chant,
reminding one of a dead march: it is very impressive
and by no means unmusical. I was told it was
composed by an Englishman&mdash;who he was I do not
know. Then the Prince rode into the garden, followed
by his brother, Nasrullah Khan. Both were dressed
in scarlet and gold uniforms. Prince Habibullah wore
a military helmet with plumes, and Nasrullah Khan
a grey astrakhan hat. I bowed as the Prince went
by, and he pulled up to enquire why I had not taken
possession of the tent prepared for me, and he pointed
out a very gay one. There were people in it, but
they turned out at once. The Prince gave orders
to one of the chamberlains for tea and cigarettes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
be served for me there, and then rode on to another
tent, where he dismounted. Taking his seat he
received the salaams of the assembled guests. I sat
in my tent, and people came in and chatted, and then
went on to other tents. I drank tea, ate fruit, and
smoked, while musicians and nautch women went
through their performances. Then large trays of
sweetmeats and sugar were brought to each of the
tents, and when I had eaten a little I departed, for
it began to rain. The servants of each of the guests
carried away their master’s tray of sweets, for it was
the fast of Ramazan, when Mahomedans cannot eat
nor drink till night. The father of the bride was the
Shaghassi, or Master of the Ceremonies in Mazar,
and when we left there he was made governor of
Turkestan. Soon after we left, however, he had
sunstroke&mdash;mania, the hakims said&mdash;and the Amîr
recalled him to Kabul.</p>

<p>I found my horse waiting for me at the gate of the
garden. In spite of the rain, the streets were crammed
with people, and I had some trouble in the crowd, for
my horse was restive, and plunged; however, we got
home without accident. I went also to the wedding
of Prince Nasrullah, but I will describe that later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Faith Cure.</div>

<p>Some of the priests have gained a certain amount
of reputation as healers of the sick; not by the
administration of medicines, for that is a privilege
reserved for the hakims and doctors, but by the
employment of the “faith cure.” It is an axiom
in the Mahomedan religion that to utter the name
of God a great number of times is of inestimable
benefit to both body and soul; also that if a part
of the body be diseased, it is an efficient cure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
bind on it the written name of one of the attributes
of God, “the Merciful,” “the Compassionate,” “the
Restorer.” The sick, therefore, go first to the
priest for help, and by the payment of a fee obtain
the written scroll. This is rolled up in silk or
leather, or, if the patient be wealthy enough, is
enclosed in a little cylindrical box of silver made
for the purpose, and bound on the diseased part of
the body. If the patient recover, great credit is
given to the priest, and other sick people seek his
aid. If recovery does not ensue, either the patient
is resigned, considering that his “Nasîb” is thus
written in the book of fate, or else by the payment
of a larger fee he engages the medical skill of the
hakims, or native physicians.</p>

<p>Every patient with chronic disease of any kind
who came to me had one of these little packets
fastened by a string round his arm or neck.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Evil Eye.</div>

<p>Many of the children, even those in good health,
have similar charms fastened to them. I noticed
that the Sultana, or her women, fastened one in a
gold cylindrical box on the arm of the little Prince
Mahomed Omar, soon after he was born. This
was to protect him from accident or other evil.
Sometimes, for the same purpose, a piece of string
only, over which a few prayers have been recited,
is tied round the child’s limb. This is done by the
poorer people. Against the “Evil Eye”&mdash;which,
as far as I could understand, is the eye of “envy,
hatred, and malice”&mdash;something blue is a great
protection. Men wear turquoise rings, children and
woman turquoise ornaments or blue beads. When
a man buys a new horse the servants at once fasten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a blue bead or ribbon among the hairs of his tail.
It is not necessary for the blue to be seen: it is
just as sure a protection when it is hidden. The
Evil Eye is a dangerous weapon, so many possess
it, and it works silently and secretly. Paralysis,
wasting, rickets in children, impotence, and sudden
death, the illness of cattle and horses&mdash;all these are
imputed to the evil eye.</p>

<p>Just outside the house I occupied, after my return
from Turkestan to Kabul, there was an open space
with a small pond in the middle; this was a favourite
playground for the boys of the neighbourhood. I
rode through it as usual one morning on my way
to the hospital. When I had finished my work
and returned home again, my interpreter, who
seemed rather upset about something, said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, I very sorry you kill that boy to-day.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” I said; “I’ve not killed
any boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir; you remember he called you
Feringhi this morning.”</p>

<p>I remembered then that while riding through the
playground, one of the boys, a good-looking lad of
about twelve, had attracted my attention by calling
out something, and he laughed as he ran away. I
looked up carelessly and then rode on, thinking no
more about it. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I remember a boy saying something, but I
didn’t hear what it was.”</p>

<p>“Sir, he very fool boy to call you Feringhi, but he
is dead now.”</p>

<p>“That is very sudden! What did he die of?”
I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, sir, I poor man&mdash;what I know? You looked
at him, and he died; perhaps trouble come for us.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I said, “he must have died of something.
Boys don’t die because you look at them.”</p>

<p>“Sir, in this country often it is they do!”</p>

<p>I indignantly said, “What do you mean! <em>I</em>
haven’t got the evil eye!”</p>

<p>He looked at me meaningly, then looked on the
ground and shook his head dolefully: I couldn’t
persuade him that the thing was a ridiculous impossibility.
As there is a kind of vendetta in
Afghanistan I rather wondered what would happen
next. I told my interpreter to make enquiries and
find out what the boy really died of. He said,</p>

<p>“Why for we make enquiries? Better it is we
keep quiet for a few days and say nothing.”</p>

<p>I never heard what was the cause of death, and
the matter blew over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ghosts.</div>

<p>Besides the evil eye the Afghans believe in other
forms of magic; in certain days of the week being
lucky, and others unlucky; in ghosts, and jins, or
devils. A man told me one day that the house he
lived in was formerly occupied by the three sisters of
one of the kings, Shah Shujah, I think it was, and
that they were evil women. One night on his return
home, just as he entered the house he heard sound
of women’s laughter in the bath-room on the ground
floor. Wondering who could be there, he opened the
door. Three women, whom he did not recognize,
sprang up and rushed, laughing, through the further
door into the inner bath-room. He slammed the
door to, and fastened it, and hurried upstairs, where
he found his wife and the women of the household.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
He enquired who were the women in the
bath-room. They said there could be no women.
The house was of the usual kind&mdash;only one door
leading from the street into the courtyard, and every
one entering could be seen. Lights were procured,
and he descended to the bath-room, unfastened the
door, opened it, and peeped in&mdash;no one was there.
He went across to the further door and found it
fastened with a chain and padlock on the outside
in the usual way. He thought, “The women cannot
have fastened themselves in.” He took the key from
his pocket, unlocked the door and looked in: this
room also was empty. He is convinced he saw the
wraiths of the women who formerly occupied his
house.</p>

<p>Almost every house in Kabul has its ghost or jin.
The house I had on my return from Turkestan had
a reputation. The soldiers who were put to guard
it in the winter while I was at the Palace at last
refused to sleep in one of the ground floor rooms.
They said it was haunted, that jins and devils came
and pinched them, and moved their rifles and belts
from where they had placed them. So in spite of
the intense cold they moved out into the porch of the
big gate opening from the courtyard into the street,
and there they took up their quarters permanently.
One day, just before sunset, after I had returned, the
syce came out of the stable, which was under the room
I occupied, and called one of the other servants. The
latter came to me afterwards and said that just as it
was beginning to get dusk he went to look into the
stable, as the syce had called him. To his astonishment
he saw what seemed to him to be two small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
children running round the legs of the bay horse,
and jumping on its neck and off again. He went
forward to gain a clearer view, and the children,
or jins, as he called them, disappeared. He searched
the stable thoroughly, and found nothing out of the
way, except that the bay horse was trembling and
covered with sweat.</p>

<p>Many similar stories were related to me at different
times, but though for months I slept alone in the
“haunted wing” I never saw any ghost, jin, or
devil&mdash;except those clothed with flesh and blood;
doubtless it was a privilege reserved for “True
Believers.” There was, however, one incident; but
I will relate that by and bye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Machinery Accidents.</div>

<p>One morning soon after our arrival in Kabul, when
I was at the Erg hospital, a messenger arrived in a
great hurry to say a man had been injured at the
Workshops. I jumped on my horse, which was
waiting, and galloped off. Just outside the Workshop
garden, on the road by the river bank, I saw the
heavy portable engine with a crowd of people round
it. Mr. Pyne was there in the middle of the crowd,
and a man, one of the Afghan workmen, was lying on
the ground. I examined the patient and found he was
dead. Mr. Pyne was very upset and at first refused to
believe it. He sent off a man to the shops for whisky,
and begged me to send someone to the hospital for
ammonia. I did so, though, of course, it was useless.
They were moving the engine to the Salaam Khana
or Durbar Hall to work the dynamo for the electric
light there, but no one in the crowd seemed to have
seen how the accident occurred, whether the man
was crushed under the wheel or whether he had
been struck on the head. There was no inquest, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
post mortem examinations were not viewed with
favour.</p>

<p>Later on, when the machinery was put together
and some of it was in working order, accidents and
deaths were, as might be expected, of frequent occurrence.
In stepping over the shafting which ran across
the entrance to one of the shops, about a foot above
the ground, the long sheepskin postîn or coat would
catch, and the wearer be whirled round and killed.
Familiarity breeds contempt, and in spite of accidents
it took a long time to educate the ordinary Afghan,
after he had got over his first awe, up to the point
of learning that machinery in motion should be
approached with circumspection.</p>

<p>They had a way of putting their fingers under
the punches of the cartridge machines, forgetting
that the punch would inevitably come down at its
appointed moment. It took one man in the palm, I
remember, and I had to amputate his first and
second finger and his thumb. Another got his hand
between some steel rollers in motion, and but for
the fact that Mr. Pyne was on the spot and at once
threw the machine out of gear, the arm would have
gone too. As it was, the skin was taken neatly and
cleanly from the wrist and turned backwards like a
glove over the finger tips. The bones of the hand
were crushed, and I wished to amputate in the
lower forearm; but the man, who was brought to
the hospital, refused to have the hand taken off
because he could move the fingers a little. I pointed
out the danger he was running of further serious
results, but he would not consent.</p>

<p>As he refused the only treatment that I felt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
suitable, I could not undertake to treat him, and he
was removed to his home in the city. I do not know
who attended to his hurts, probably one of the
native “dressers,” but four or five days afterwards
he sent a friend to beg that I would come and
remove the hand. Unfortunately, it was too late;
“tetanus,” or lockjaw, had set in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afghan Treatment of Dislocations.</div>

<p>The “dressers” of wounds in Afghanistan are a
body of men&mdash;natives&mdash;whose duty it is to dress
wounds and ulcers, set broken limbs, and probe for
bullets. They have no knowledge of even the
groundwork of their profession. Never having
dissected, nor studied anatomy, they are quite
ignorant of the position and shape of the bones, to
say nothing of the course and distribution of the
larger arteries of the human body, so that the
abscess knife and the scalpel put into the hands of
one of these men work grievous harm. They carry
about with them a flat tin box, with partitions
inside, something like a paint box; and in it is a
collection of most filthy looking ointments of
different colours. These they plaster on indiscriminately;
if one does not cure an ulcer perhaps
another will. For dislocation of joints a mixture of
flour and yolk of eggs smeared on is a certain
specific; they have no idea of reducing the dislocation.
For a broken bone, flour and yolk of eggs
again comes in. Say the bone of one arm is broken
between the shoulder and elbow, the following
treatment is adopted. Some narrow strips of calico,
smeared with the flour and egg mixture, are bound
tightly round the limb at the seat of injury; thus
breaking the first law of surgery, that no bandage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
be put on under a splint. Over this bandage are
arranged longitudinally four or five narrow pieces of
wood about five inches long, very like those you
buy in a bundle for firewood, and utterly useless as
splints, and another bandage is wound firmly over
these; there is no padding with cotton wool. The
patient is then left. The result is, of course, that
the limb below the bandages becomes exceedingly
swollen and painful.</p>

<p>When the pain has reached such a pitch that it
is no longer bearable, the patient releases his arm
from the bandages, and the dresser is sent for to
readjust them, so that the unfortunate limb is
relieved for a time before it is tortured afresh. In
spite of the dresser the bone sometimes unites,
usually at a more or less obtuse angle; but not
uncommonly, especially in compound or comminuted
fractures, the pressure is taken off too late, and the
whole limb mortifies. The patient, after months of
suffering, may or may not recover. I have had them
brought to me with the broken end of the bone
protruding from a hanging mass of stringy and
sloughing muscle and tendon, the rest of the limb
being hidden from sight by unclean rags.</p>

<p>Such “dressers” as I could get hold of I put
through an examination at the hospital, to try and
find out what they knew, and endeavoured to teach
them some elementary facts in anatomy and one or
two common sense rules in surgery, but only one of
them would even pretend to learn, and he was a
humbug. They all knew better than I did how to
treat wounds and ulcers, and set broken limbs, and
they received any suggestions of mine in offended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
silence. I showed up one or two, pointing out the
disastrous results of their treatment, but it did no
good. I only had an extra enemy or two to consider,
for they were very venomous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Barber Surgeons.</div>

<p>Besides the comparatively modern “dressers,”
there is another body of men in Kabul who practise
the noble art of surgery, namely, the “barbers.” The
line they specially take up is that of bleeding and
tooth drawing. They have very rough forceps for
the latter operation, and when, as not infrequently
happened, they snapped the crown of a tooth off
instead of extracting it, they passed the patient on to
me. It is annoying for a surgeon to have to extract
broken but firmly-fixed fangs from an injured and
bleeding jaw. It is not a pretty operation at all.</p>

<p>For fevers, dyspepsia, gout, headache, or any
feeling of malaise, the barbers bled their patients&mdash;but
besides these, which may be called the <em>irregular</em>
bleedings, there are regular bleedings every spring
and autumn. These are generally done out of doors
by the road side. The barber, squatting down by
the side of his patient, makes his incision at the
bend of the elbow: fortunately, not into the vein
immediately over the great artery of the arm, the
one usually bled from in England, but into one
adjoining. The patient holds out his arm and allows
the blood to drip on to the ground till he thinks
enough has run away. There is not the slightest
attempt made to measure the quantity of blood
lost. The only precaution taken is to avoid drinking
any water for twenty-four hours afterwards, lest
it should mix with the rest of the blood in the vein
and make it thin; or if they do drink any they hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the wounded arm above their heads to prevent the
water running into it! Wet cupping, too, is performed
by the barbers and dressers, and is a very
popular means among the townsfolk of getting rid
of their blood. It is a common thing to see an
Afghan scarred all over the shoulders and loins.
Cupping is employed generally as a remedy for
muscular rheumatism. The custom was introduced
some years ago by the Hindustani hospital assistants,
who, after having had in India some slight training
in the European system of medicine, found their way
into Afghanistan under the guise of “doctors.” The
majority of these were unqualified men, and were
quite unfit to be anything but hospital assistants.
Let loose upon the people they have worked as
much havoc among the sick as a similar number
of the hakims could have done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eye Doctors and Hakims.</div>

<p>There are also native “eye doctors!” These
may do good sometimes by accident, though I never
heard of a case, but they do an incredible amount
of harm: for eye diseases, on account of the glare
and the dust, the absence of proper treatment and
ordinary care are very common in Afghanistan.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Finding out that I sometimes used sulphate of
copper&mdash;an astringent and caustic&mdash;of which there
was plenty to be had in the bazaars, they would
put this powdered into any eye&mdash;say, of a child who
had ulcer of the cornea! The Hindustani hospital
assistants were not much wiser, for they sometimes
used solutions of sulphate of zinc, a similar remedy,
for the same purpose. The eye being irreparably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
damaged the patient is then handed on to me, and the
Hindustani, like the dresser, smugly says that “If <em>he</em>
couldn’t cure the patient, neither could the Feringhi.”</p>

<p>However, the people and the Amîr judged, I
found, according to general results. I remember in
Turkestan a soldier getting leave of absence, travelling
down to Kabul, and bringing his old mother on
a donkey the two hundred odd miles over the mountains,
for me to cure her eyes. They were past all
hope.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The painful part of the affair was that they
would not believe I <em>could</em> not, but that I <em>would</em> not
restore her eyes; and the old woman went down
on her knees to implore.</p>

<p>There was one old fellow, an “eye doctor,” in
Kabul, whom I used to notice on my way to the
hospital. He sat in a hut of rushes and mud by the
roadside, with his medicines in little packets before
him. I often wished he would come and have a little
elementary instruction in the “eye.” But he had
such a sour expression when I went by, and he
never would look at me, that I did not suggest it
to him.</p>

<p>The hakims&mdash;the physicians of Afghanistan&mdash;practise
purely as physicians; they do not use the
knife surgically, rarely even for bleeding. When
they find it necessary to treat an abscess, they
apply an irritating ointment which causes ulceration
of the skin. Since the introduction of European
drugs into Afghanistan some of the hakims have
made use of them; but as they do so in ignorance
of their therapeutic properties, the results are rarely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
satisfactory, and, in some cases, are disastrous.
They have great faith in the healing properties of a
purge, but do not consider it has had any effect unless
it acts at least twenty times. The way is prepared by
administering every day for a week a large bowl of
laxative mixture; afterwards, one or more bowls
of a drastic purge are given. Some of the people
seem to establish toleration of this class of medicine,
and require a large dose before they are acted on;
but with a vast number this mode of treatment,
combined with the custom of eating largely of ripe
and semi-ripe fruit, certainly predisposes them to the
obstinate and often fatal bowel affections that are
such a scourge in the spring and autumn.</p>

<p>These bowel troubles, according to a popular
native idea, are caused by drinking tea immediately
after having eaten fruit, particularly mulberries.
There is no doubt, however, that some of the cases
are due to the debilitated and enfeebled state of the
digestive organs, produced by the malarial poison,
the immediate exciting cause often being the sudden
change in temperature experienced when climbing a
mountain after a residence in the hot valleys.
Other cases are due to the presence of minute
intestinal parasites, the ova of these being ingested
during the drinking of impure water, a common
custom among the careless Afghans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of Disease by Hakims.</div>

<p>The hakims practise, I was informed, according
to the Yunani or ancient Greek system of medicine.
The only books I could obtain on this system were
written in Arabic, and this was an obstacle to my
studying them; but, whatever the teaching of their
books may be, the hakims I found knew nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
whatever about anatomy, physiology, or pathology.
Their treatment of disease is entirely empirical.
They act according to “authority.” Studying
disease, not in the living subject, but in their books
only, they have made no progress whatever upon the
teaching of their ancestors. A sick man is brought
to them, and some prominent symptom forces itself
upon their notice. This is at once diagnosed as the
disease. For instance, pain in the abdomen is to
them “colic.” It is described in their books and a
certain line of treatment is directed. They do not
examine their patient, or attempt to find a cause for
his pain; nor do they differentiate between different
forms of colic, for they have not noticed that pain in
the abdomen is sometimes unconnected with the
bowel. As an example, Perwana Khan, the Deputy
Commander-in-Chief in Kabul (“Dipti Supersala”),
was for some weeks attended by the hakims, who,
reporting him to be suffering from colic, administered
purge after purge. As, however, he did not seem to
be getting any better, the Amîr desired me to
examine him. I found he had acute pain in the left
loin, shooting downwards; the attacks of pain came
on, he said, after he had been riding on horseback,
and he had other symptoms, all pointing unmistakably
to stone in the kidney. I administered
suitable medicine for the relief of the pain, and he
was overjoyed, imagining himself cured. I explained,
however, to His Highness what was wrong.</p>

<p>To the hakims dropsy is a disease, and can be
cured by the treatment set forth in their books. No
attempt is made to discover the cause of the dropsy&mdash;whether
it is due to kidney disease, heart, liver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
lung or blood disease&mdash;it is simply an accumulation of
gas (bâd) in the tissues! In diseases of the chest,
they do not, of course, employ auscultation with
a stethoscope, nor percussion; and bronchitis, pneumonia,
and phthisis are classed together under the
name of sûrfa, or cough. This, they say, is due
to an accumulation of “slime” (balgham) in the
body. In some cases the sûrfa is accompanied by
dard i sîna, or pain in the chest, and occasionally
blood as well as slime is coughed up: these are
recognized as bad cases. I have related the case
of the young brigadier in Turkestan, cousin of the
Sultana, whom the hakims were treating for sûrfa,
and who was dying of an improperly treated
pneumonia, which had, eventually, become tubercular.
As I did not want to have the credit of killing him,
I sent in my report to the Amîr at once. The
hakims did not in the least mind my being sent
for to their cases, after they had become hopeless;
for, like the dressers, they said, “Behold, the
Feringhi doctor cannot cure them any more
than we.”</p>

<p>Malarial fevers are diagnosed as “cold fever”
or “hot fever” (tap i larza&mdash;tap i gurrum), according
to whether there is a shivering stage or not. They
are treated by copious bleedings and purgings, and
by very low diet. Malarial fever, however, being
due to the presence in the blood corpuscles of a
microscopic animal, an amæba, the treatment that
the hakims adopted was not likely to be very
successful. Quinine in sufficient dose destroys this
organism, but the hakims would rarely give it, or if,
following my plan, they did so, they gave it in doses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
so small as to be useless, for they said, “Quinine is
<em>hot</em>, and, therefore, bad for fever.”</p>

<p>What they meant I do not know.</p>

<p>The hakims divide not only malarial fevers into
“hot and cold,” but they arrange all diseases into
these two classes, and I was asked of almost every
disease that came under my notice whether it were
hot or cold; for instance, whether dyspepsia were hot
or cold. The reason for the classification in the
case of malarial fevers is obvious enough, but for
the other diseases I never was able to find out upon
what they founded their conclusions. It certainly
was not simply whether the patient had fever or not.</p>

<p>It was particularly embarrassing when the Amîr
asked the question, and I once told His Highness
that in Europe we did not speak of diseases as being
either hot or cold, that it was often impossible to
consider them as either one or the other. His
Highness was quite indignant at my denying what
apparently seemed to him such a self-evident fact,
so much so that he doubted if my interpreter had
translated what I had said correctly. After that,
when I was asked, I told the interpreter to class the
disease as hot or cold, according to the custom of the
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of Disease by the People.</div>

<p>In the distant villages, where there is no hakim,
and the priest’s amulet has failed to cure, the
people either go untreated or treat themselves. A
popular mode of treatment for diseases of bones and
joints, and also for almost any pain in the chest,
abdomen, or back, is the employment of the “actual
cautery.” A piece of live charcoal is placed against
the skin until a deep burn is produced; this is done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
in two or three places, the scars, of course, remaining
till the end of the patient’s life.</p>

<p>Another custom, mostly for diseases accompanied
by fever, is to kill a sheep, skin it rapidly, and at
once wrap the patient in the hot skin. I do not
know that it does any harm. The Amîr himself,
when suffering from gout, and when the hakims had
failed to relieve him, employed this essentially
Afghan mode of treatment for his leg and foot.
Afterwards he sent for me.</p>

<p>For wounds, ulcers, or abscesses the villagers bind
on either a piece of fresh sheepskin, which they
leave on till it stinks, or a piece of an old water bag
(mussack), which they soften afresh by soaking.
Sometimes they plaster on mud or clay. In the case
of ulcers, the fact that they <em>never</em> heal under these
circumstances does not seem to strike the Afghans,
and they continue in the old custom. If the discharge
oozes from under the clay they plaster on a little
more. Cover a sore, get it out of sight, is the golden
rule of hakims, dressers, and people. The condition
of the ulcer when the clay is removed is indescribable.
In some cases the only possible treatment is the
removal of the limb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Feringhi as a Healer.</div>

<p>I noticed that the richer and more educated
Afghans did not seem so ready to avail themselves
of European medical aid as the poorer people, and it
struck me there were two reasons for this. First, that
the hakims took the trouble to explain to the richer
people, from whom they expected to receive fees, that
Europeans use deadly poisons in their medicines,
which are just as likely to kill as to cure. A certain
amount of weight attaches to this by the often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
unfortunate results of medical treatment by the
Hindustani hospital assistants. The other reason
seems to be due, not to the hakims, but to the
influence of the priests. The more religious of the
Afghans apparently look upon a European as one
who, by the help of the Powers of Evil, has in this
world the gifts of knowledge, skill, and wealth, but
who in the next life must inevitably be consigned to
eternal torment. Doubtless with his deadly poisons
he can cure diseases if he wish, but it is not wise, and,
indeed, is scarcely lawful, for a sick man to make use
of him.</p>

<p>They feel it will offend God less if, before they
traffic with the evil one by employing a Feringhi
doctor, they use all lawful and right means to become
well, such as trying the efficacy of prayer, or the
wearing of amulets and charms: should these fail,
by placing themselves under the care of their
hereditary physicians, the hakims, who attended their
fathers and their fathers’ fathers. They can always
call in the Feringhi as a last resource.</p>

<p>The peasants and the hillmen, the soldiers and
the poorer townsfolk&mdash;in fact, all those who are but
occasionally under the influence of the priests, and
from whom the hakims can expect a small, if any fee&mdash;these
are ready enough to trust themselves, when
sick, to European medical skill. They take advantage
of that which seems to them good, as an animal might,
without entering upon the deeper question whether
it is religiously right or wrong&mdash;in fact, they even look
upon a doctor as one to be classed with Dewanas or
madmen, and prophets, who are all more or less
sacred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be a powerful reason, such as the fear of
being poisoned or damned, that prevents the richer
Afghans from employing European medical aid,
for they have to pay the hakims, whereas at the
hospital no fees or presents were received, and it is
not the nature of an Afghan to pay for a thing if
he can get it for nothing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jealousy: Revenge.</div>

<p>About a month after our arrival in Kabul an
incident occurred which, though gruesome in its
details, I cannot refrain from relating on account
of the light which it throws upon the nature of the
Afghan.</p>

<p>One of the soldiers had made a favourite of a
boy in the town. Some time afterwards the boy was
seen to associate with another man in the cantonment.
At once the jealousy of the soldier was aroused. He
taxed the boy with it, and in a moment of jealous
anger he drove his knife into him, killing him
instantly.</p>

<p>Forthwith the mother of the lad appealed to Prince
Habibullah for justice and revenge. She claimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
life of the murderer. The Prince heard the case in
detail, and, according to the Afghan law (an eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth), granted the woman’s
request. The soldier was hurried off to the execution
ground, close to the hospital where I was. His
hands were fastened behind him, and he was tied in
a sitting posture in a chair. A knife was handed to
the woman: she seized the man’s beard, wrenched
his head back, and with a cry of “Allah, akbar,” cut
his throat. Then, flinging down the knife, she
plunged her hands in the spirting stream, and
lapped the blood into her mouth.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Mahomedan Sabbath, there being
no work in the workshops, Mr. Pyne and I went for
a ride along the beautiful lanes fringed with poplars,
which lie between the fields around Kabul.</p>

<p>We saw in a large field among the young green
corn some seven or eight horsemen sitting silently
on their horses. Presently I recognized the slender
form of Prince Nasrullah. We rode up to salute
His Highness, and he informed us he was hawking
for partridges. The bird used was, I believe, a
species of falcon, though I am not sufficiently skilled
an ornithologist to say what species. The bird is
carried, hooded, on the wrist, and is unhooded and
cast off when the prey is sighted. For large game
the bigger female falcon is used.</p>

<p>The group of riders made quite a picture as they
sat: the gold embroidery of their military uniforms
sparkling in the sun; the black of the astrakhan
hat, the long waving mane and tail of the horses,
all sharply distinct against the background of soft
spring green and distant shadowy mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mountain “Sportsmen.”</div>

<p>As a nation the Afghans are fond of sport.
Game of many kinds is plentiful in the country. A
short time ago, the sport of all sports&mdash;for the
excitement of great possible gain came in&mdash;was the
picking off of unwary travellers and annexing their
belongings. Here was not only sport but the
indulgence of a passion so dear to the Afghan, that
of gambling.</p>

<p>A sportsman on the hills saw trudging along the
road a traveller with a burden on his shoulders.
From the distance he examined him with care.</p>

<p>“To my eye this traveller has rupees and much
gold in his pack. Without doubt he is a rascal
Hindu usurer, who, journeying to Kabul, is about
to plunder the Faithful. Soul of my father! Shall
this be?” And the bullet sped on its way.
Springing from rock to rock, with agility born of a
mountain life, the sportsman was soon on the road.
Quickly he opened the pack and&mdash;out rolled a melon.</p>

<p>His arms sunk to his sides, his head drooped,
and he stood the picture of despair. For his sins
he was thus punished. “Tobah! tobah! alas and
alas!” he groaned; “my cartridge, my good
cartridge is gone, wasted, for ever lost; and I,
what have I? a melon! Wai! wai!” and he wept.</p>

<p>But, nowadays, since the great king, Amîr
Abdurrahman, has occupied the throne, this form of
sport is less popular than it was. Possibly it may
be due to the fact that consequences far from
pleasing to the sportsmen and their friends are apt to
follow indulgence in this pastime. Imprisonment has
occurred; the being compelled to work in chains on
the roads or in the workshops; ignominious death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
even, as by hanging, or by being thrust into an iron
cage and left thirsting on the high peak of a mountain.
So, therefore, as I said, it is becoming less popular.</p>

<p>There are, however, many other forms of sport.
Wild-fowl shooting in the marshes around Kabul
is a favourite pastime.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sportsmen go in a body on horseback,
ride into the marsh where it is shallow, disturb
the duck and fire into the flight. Sometimes they
go singly, conceal themselves and use a decoy. In
the plains they stalk the deer or use a body of
beaters to drive the game to certain points. In
Turkestan, tiger, wild pig&mdash;which they shoot&mdash;and
bear are to be obtained. Duck shooting in the
autumn and winter, and hawking in the spring are,
perhaps, the sports in which the Royal Family most
frequently indulge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Start for Turkestan.</div>

<p>Not very long after our arrival in Kabul it was
rumoured that the Amîr needed my services in
Turkestan, and a month and a-half afterwards the
official order arrived. I was to accompany Jan
Mahomed Khan, the Treasury Officer, who was about
to convey a supply of bullion to Turkestan for the
use of His Highness. Accordingly, as soon as I
received the order, I engaged some servants: a
Peshawuri&mdash;the “assassin,” whom I have already
referred to&mdash;as valet, and a Hindustani cook, whom I
found in Kabul. I was fortunate in being able to
obtain a cook, as hitherto Mr. Pyne and I had shared
one between us. The man I engaged had been cook
in the family of Sir Louis Cavagnari. The other
servants were Afghans. After some extra cooking
pots, dried fruit, salt, and various other things, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the cook said he must get from the bazaar, were
obtained, and the baggage was packed, Mr. Pyne
accompanied me to the house of Jan Mahomed Khan.
We were received in a large room, which was crowded
with people standing. We seated ourselves at the
end and drank tea with Jan Mahomed. Then a bottle
of champagne was opened, complimentary speeches
made, and, finally, about midday we started. We
stopped at the Palace, dismounted, and went in to
take leave of His Highness, the Prince. When we
remounted we were met outside the Palace by
Perwana Khan, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief, and
Naib Mir Sultan, the Governor of Kabul, each with
their attendants, so that with our own crowd of
servants, and a guard of sixty soldiers, we made a
large cavalcade. A crowd of people on foot accompanied
us part of the way, running by the side and in
front of the horses. The sun shone brightly; the
dresses of the officials&mdash;crimson, and purple, and
green&mdash;were brilliant with gold embroidery. The
glitter of the gold and silver ornaments on belt,
scabbard, and bridle, the blue and gold turbans of the
attendants, the black sheepskin busbies of the soldiers,
horses caracoling, and the look of bustle and excitement,
made an artistic and interesting picture.</p>

<p>We rode by the bank of the Kabul river westward,
past the workshops and through the gorge between
the Sher Durwaza and Asmai mountains out into the
Charhardeh valley.</p>

<p>The first day’s journey was short, for we went
only a few miles across the valley to a place called
Chiltan, where on a hill Jan Mahomed has a “country
residence.” The house was pretty, and well built,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
in the style of a bungalow with a verandah; around
it were flower gardens with a small fountain. Down
the hill and around the foot of it were vines and
fruit trees, and the view from the house was over
the cornfields and vineyards of the beautiful Charhardeh
valley, circled with mountains.</p>

<p>The Governor of Kabul did not accompany us
to the house, but the rest of us sat down to
dinner together, in the Mahomedan fashion, that is,
on the ground. Pyne and I were accommodated with
cushions. As we were not able to double our legs
up in the Eastern fashion we “reclined.” It was my
first “native” dinner, and I enjoyed it immensely, for
the ride and excitement had made us hungry. With
the fruit, champagne was brought, and afterwards
sweets and tea. Then when we lit our cigars nautch
girls and musicians were introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nautch Dancer.</div>

<p>I can speak of the wild barbaric music from
seithar, rubarb, and drum; of the passionate Oriental
love song pealing forth in unison from strong male
voices; of the unveiled girl dancers undulating to
the music; of the glances cast by the dark eyes, the
waving of arms, the clinking of bangles, and the
tinkling of bells on their ankles, as the dancers
stepped daintily on the carpet.</p>

<p>I can also speak of the indescribable ear-splitting
din, without either time or tune, which was torn
from the tortured instruments and hurled at us as
“music;” of the harsh voices roaring till they were
hoarse something which we did not understand; of
the attempts of the singers to produce a trill by
shaking the head; of the utter absence of modulation
or feeling in their singing; of the dancing women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
shuffling about, clapping their hands and throwing
themselves into uncouth and to us unmeaning
postures; and I thought, “Oh, for an hour of
Augustus Druriolanus to open the eyes of these
Easterns.”</p>

<p>We turned in at midnight, Pyne and I sharing
a room, and he broke my only egg cup with his
heel. We started next morning at eight, said good-bye
to Pyne, who returned to Kabul to superintend
the workshops, and then rode on. On the way
villagers came out and lined the road to salaam
Jan Mahomed and offer him presents. As they stood
in a row they held out their hands, palm upwards,
muttered a prayer, and stroked their beards&mdash;that is,
those who had beards: the young men and boys
who had not, pretended to do so. At some places
they slung a string across the road with a Koran
fixed in the middle of it, and as we passed under
it we held out our hands, palm upwards, muttered
a prayer, and stroked our beards. At other places
they killed a bullock or a calf by cutting its throat.
I do not know the significance of the operation.</p>

<p>It rained somewhat when we got among the
mountains, and Jan Mahomed, who had on a purple
velvet tunic, put up an umbrella to protect himself.
I found he had brought his little son, four years
old with him. The youngster was seated in a little
chair, which was securely fastened on the back of
a steady horse, an attendant holding a leading rein.
I was not on very good terms myself with my horse.
He was a very showy creature, and had been given
me by the Prince, but he had evidently not been
ridden lately, and was very fresh. A march is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
fatiguing function at the best of times, and my horse
was not up to the quick shuffling walk which is so
restful. He would do anything else&mdash;buck, kick,
gallop, or trot. Finally Jan Mahomed ordered one
of the soldiers, an iron Afghan, to change with me,
and I was at peace again.</p>

<p>Sometimes we stopped at a village and put up
in the different houses; other times the tents were
pitched near a stream. When we got among the
Paghman offshoot of the Hindu Kush mountains
we had pelting rain and sleet for hours; a violent
storm of thunder and lightning; then had to ford
a wide roaring stream with a stony irregular bed,
and, finally, to camp outside a Hazara fortified village
in the sloppy melting snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Courtesy of Jan Mahomed.</div>

<p>The village (Kharzar) was too filthy inside
for us to enter, and too cramped in space to accommodate
us, if we had entered. I went to
look&mdash;for my tent had not arrived. For food the
villagers were too ill provided themselves to be
able to sell us anything, and hungry, wet, and tired,
it seemed likely we should have a cheerless night.
When Jan Mahomed’s tent was ready he kindly
invited me to enter it. I took off my soaked ulster,
sloshed and slipped into the dusk of the tent, sat
on a stool, and shivered miserably. Nothing else
seeming to be forthcoming, a pipe was the only
resource, and with shaking hand I tried to light
it. Match after match fizzed in the damp and went
out. The pipe chattered in my teeth, and, woe is
me, I felt that the cold and the wet and the hungry
emptiness would last for ever. But it did not.
Jan Mahomed Khan noticed presently that I seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
uncomfortable. He rose from the camp stool on
which he was sitting enveloped in the voluminous
folds of a huge sheepskin postîn, came across the tent,
slipped the postîn from his shoulders and threw it
around me. I tried to refuse; but he insisted.
He said nothing, for he could not speak English nor
I Persian, then he smiled, bowed and sat down again.
I felt very grateful, and at the same time rather
ashamed at having robbed him, but presently a soldier
brought him a cloak in which he wrapped himself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the attendants, having succeeded
in obtaining some straw, scattered it thickly inside
the tent and spread carpets over it. Then they
endeavoured to light a fire in a large iron pot
outside, and when there was a feeble glimmer of
a flame they brought it in. We gathered round
it joyfully, but soon a dense fog of smoke from the
damp wood filled the tent. Though I still shivered
under the postîn, I had managed to light my pipe,
and I sat puffing away with the smarting tears
trickling down, finally the smoke fog became so
dense that I was compelled to sit with my eyes shut.
Neither Jan Mahomed nor any of the Afghans seemed
to mind it in the least. Jan Mahomed himself is
not an Afghan. He is a Samarcandi whom the
Amîr purchased as a boy. He was the Amîr’s
faithful attendant when in exile in Russian Turkestan;
and when His Highness came to the throne Jan
Mahomed was put into a position of trust, finally
becoming treasury officer, or “Chancellor of the
Exchequer.”</p>

<p>The tent, by-and-bye, became warmer, and I took
off my solar helmet which I had worn during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
rain storms. The Afghans, however, attach great
importance to keeping the head warm, and they
all insisted upon my putting on that or some other
head covering at once; otherwise, they said, I
should take fever. The fire began to blaze up
brightly and the smoke to disappear, when an iron
vessel was brought, containing a few pints of
milk with water added to eke out the quantity.
They put it over the fire and, when it boiled, a handful
of tea was thrown in. There was enough for all
in the tent to have a teacupful; I, the guest, and
Jan Mahomed, received two each. By-and-bye, an
iron camp bedstead was prepared for my host, and
he retired; one of the attendants kneading and
massaging the limbs till he slept. My bedding not
having turned up I threw a buffalo rug over my
feet, and lay down on the carpet enveloped in the
folds of the sheepskin. It was not a comfortable
bed, but I was tired and slept more or less, waking
up occasionally with aching bones.</p>

<p>The morning was bright: the rising sun in the
clear sky lit up the white snow all around, and a
keen wind was blowing. My interpreter, the
Armenian, appeared. He said he had had fever in
the night, and had found shelter in one of the huts
inside the Hazara fort. He brought me a small piece
of dry bread which the cook had found among the
baggage when my tent arrived. Some hot tea was
made, and I munched my crust with great satisfaction.
They told me we should have a cold march that day,
by Hajiguk, and the Armenian said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, you not wear the long coat; he is wet, and
fever come for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“I must wear something,” I said.</p>

<p>“Another you have,” said he, and off he went.
He presently returned with my dressing-gown. I
objected; but, no, there was nothing extraordinary
in it; in fact, it was very like an Afghan robe. I
wore it, therefore, though it did not seem a very
suitable riding coat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mountain Climbing.</div>

<p>It was a cold march as we crunched along
through the snow, in spite of the fact that the sun
was shining brightly. We were at an altitude of over
sixteen thousand feet, and had to make long detours,
for the road was in places blocked or rendered unsafe
by the snow. In some of the detours where there
was no path, we scrambled up and down terrifying
slopes. My saddle, a hunting one, could not be
kept in place, and we had to extemporize a breast-plate
with string. In one ravine where we halted,
trying to find a way out, there was a sudden crack
and a splash. We had stopped over a stream
crusted with ice and covered with snow, and the
horse of one of the soldiers went through. The
stream, however, was shallow, and only the man’s
feet were wetted. There was a laugh as he urged
his horse out.</p>

<p>We descended from the region of snow into
valleys where the air quivered with heat, and one’s
face was nearly blistered. In one, where we stopped
for lunch, I put a clinical thermometer for a moment
against my coat sleeve. The mercury shot up to the
top at once. I was glad when we moved on again.
We passed a spring bubbling up near the road,
whose waters were impregnated with iron, the
ground all round being stained brown. Jan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Mahomed said the water contained copper and was
poisonous.</p>

<p>I remember one narrow but wild rocky ravine,
with a river foaming and roaring down it. The
road ran along a few yards above the water. There
was a natural bridge of rock, over which the road
ran, and just beyond, a waterfall of some depth,
where, at the bottom of the fall, the water
rushed under an arch of rock and was lost to
sight. It reappeared, I was told, in a valley about
two miles off, and they said His Highness the Amîr
one day, when travelling by, offered a prize of a
hundred rupees to the man who would plunge in
and explore the underground river. A duck had
been put in and had reappeared alive in the valley.
A soldier undertook the adventure at once, and was
preparing for his perilous journey when the Amîr
forbad it. His Highness said, “If he is drowned I
lose a man of courage, and if he succeed what gain
is there? Give him the rupees.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camp in the Bamian Valley.</div>

<p>We were now about ninety miles from Kabul.
For the first forty miles we travelled due west, after
that north-west, till we entered the ravine I spoke
of, which led nearly due north. As we rode on,
the ravine descended and opened into a large and
very fertile valley. The mountain at the west of
the gorge was red in colour, quite different from
those we had been travelling among. Looking up
with some interest at it, I distinguished battlemented
walls and towers leading up the mountain, and, at
the top, clusters of ruined houses and walls.
There was no sign of life. The city was deserted.
They told me the place was called Zohàk-i-Marhan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and was built a thousand years ago (“hazar sol”)
by the Emperor Alexander (“Sekunder”).</p>

<p>I did not, however, in the style of architecture
see anything that could lead one to suppose the
buildings were of Greek origin. It is interesting to
note that there is in Afghanistan a tribe called
Zohàk, which is a division of the Ushturyani
(the Stauri of Pliny), who formerly occupied the
district west of Bamian. Zohàk is stated by
Dr. Bellew to be the same as Zàk and Sàk, and
stands for the ancient inhabitants of Sistàn and
Makràn, Assyrian subjects of Nimrod, king of
Babylon.</p>

<p>We descended into the valley and camped not
far from the red mountain, near the village of
Topchi.</p>

<p>It was the month of May, the sun shone brightly,
and the fields around were green. Jan Mahomed
had brought the musicians&mdash;but not the dancing girls&mdash;with
him. We luxuriated after the bitter winds
and sleet of the mountains, and the heat and weariness
of the stony valleys. When lunch was over Jan
Mahomed sent me some sweets and a bottle of
champagne. I found that my servants, though
Mahomedans, felt they were justified after their
fatigues in finishing the bottle. The musicians sat
playing in Jan Mahomed’s tent, and as I lay in mine
reading a novel, the quaint music, softened by the
distance, was more pleasing than I had supposed
possible. For years afterwards the twang of the
rubarb, the irregular thud of the drums, and the
monotonous sound of the singing, brought back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
vividly to me that day in the Bamian valley, when
I was a new comer in the country.</p>

<p>The Bamian valley extends from Topchi nearly
ten miles in a westerly direction, and is about eight
thousand feet above the sea. It is interesting to
know that Lady Sale, Lady MacNaughten, and six
other English ladies, who were taken prisoners in
the first Afghan war in 1837, were conducted over
the road we traversed to this very valley. Lady
Sale, relating their adventures, says that though they
suffered hardship, privation, and much anxiety concerning
their future fate, they were treated with
kindness and consideration by the villagers on the
way. The order was that they were to be conducted
to Khulum, a hundred and twenty miles further on
among the mountains toward Turkestan, there to be
delivered over to the Governor. This would have
meant to them a hopeless captivity. Happily, Sir
Robert Sale, after the defeat of the Afghans by
Pollock, hurried on, and was able to rescue the party
in Bamian. Lady MacNaughten, less happy than
Lady Sale, had seen her husband, diplomatist and
Oriental scholar, murdered before her eyes in
Kabul.</p>

<p>While we were in this valley Jan Mahomed
went some miles out of the road to show me
a petrified dragon, or as my interpreter put it, “a
stone cow.” Akbar Mahomed had slain this dragon
in single combat, and Allah had changed it into stone.
“Why <i>cow</i>?” I asked the Armenian, some time afterwards.
“It is a snake or a dragon.”</p>

<p>“I not know English word snake and dragon; I
must say some animal, and ‘cow’ came into head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
therefore I say <i>cow</i>.” The dragon I found to be a
curious shaped rocky hill formed in the course of
ages by the deposit of carbonate of lime from a spring
that was still bubbling there.</p>

<br />
<i>From a photograph by Arthur Collins, F.G.S.</i></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Colossal Figures.</div>

<p>This valley was full of surprises, for the next day
we came up with three colossal figures, cut in relief
on the face of the mountains (the Hindu Kush range)
on the north side of the valley. These figures, they
said, were statues carved by order of Jelaluddin Shah,
of himself, his wife and son (Jelaluddin lived about
the year 1230). Away on the other side of the valley
we could dimly see on the heights the ruins of a
deserted city&mdash;“the city of Jelaluddin.” We were
too far off to see anything characteristic in the ruins,
but it is possible that the city belongs to the same era
as that of Zohàk-i-Marhan, a few miles further down
the valley. The figures, it is probable, are of
Buddhist origin, and date back to the time which
preceded the Mahomedan conquest of Afghanistan,
when Buddhism was the dominant religion of the
country. The largest of the three figures, which
has the local name of “Sa-mama,” is 173 feet in
height. The smaller, “Sul-sol,” 120 feet, and the
smallest not more than 80 feet. They resemble
in style other figures of Buddha. The drapery,
moulded and fastened on with pegs, shows no sign
of classical influence, arranged, as it is, in stiff
conventional folds. These are in places broken away,
showing the peg holes. To give an idea of their
relative size, I saw a man on horseback ride up
to one figure&mdash;he and his horse together were not so
high as the toe. The figures are hollow, and there
are steps leading up to chambers inside the body and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
head. These are used by the Amîr as storehouses
for grain. On the wall of the chamber, in the head of
the largest figure, are the indistinct marks of a fresco
painting, of which Mr. Collins, the geologist, managed,
some years afterwards, to get an imperfect photograph.
It is, however, impossible to make out the subject, and
I heard no story as to when or by whom it was
painted. In the face of the mountain, by the side
of the figures, are chambers or caves hollowed out
of the rock. Some of these are beautifully cut, with
domed roofs&mdash;to use the words of Mr. Collins, who
examined them&mdash;in “hard conglomerate rock, and are
coated with a layer of lustrous bitumen.” Doubtless,
they were used as temples and dwelling-places for
the Buddhist priests. Many of the other caves are
in “soft sandstone and conglomerate.” These could
be easily cut, the hard conglomerate forming a
natural roof for rooms dug in the softer sandstone
beneath. Presumably they are of later origin than
those cut in the harder material. Narrow, almost
impossible staircases lead up to the caves, and there
dwell the poorer Hazara agriculturists of the Bamian
valley. There are cave-dwellers in many parts of
Afghanistan, and it is men of this kind, who combine
the professions of agriculturist and warrior, who
would be likely to cause more trouble to an invader
of Afghanistan than would the regular army of the
Amîr. During the last Afghan war the English
were at first much puzzled by the rapidity with
which thousands of armed men would appear, and,
if occasion required, the equal rapidity with which
they would vanish. All that could be found was
here and there a peaceful peasant hard at work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in the fields with his mattock&mdash;the rifle was left
at home.</p>

<p>The furniture of one of these rock dwellings
is simple enough. The most prominent feature
is the great ornamented earthen jar, in which
grain and provisions are stored: a strip of carpet
occupies the place of honour in the centre of the
floor: a few copper cooking utensils, a “chillim,”
an Afghan “samovar” for tea, and a rough
“charpoy,” complete the establishment.</p>

<p>In the Bamian valley, fertile, full of interest
and with a delightful climate, we travelled deliberately,
taking two days to traverse the ten miles
or so. As we rode, my Armenian told me many
stories. I do not know what they were about; I didn’t
then. One only I understood. He said that once on
a march, utterly wearied, he went to sleep on horseback.
“It is thrown out,” said he, meaning himself;
and pointing to his forehead, with a mild smile,
he said, “He is broke, and blood is come.” I
laughed, and asked what happened next. “I got
him upstairs horse, but I not go to sleep again.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pass of the “Tooth-breaker.”</div>

<p>Then we turned north, and the next day was
wearisome: not so much from the length of the
march, it was only thirty miles, as from the incessant
climbing. We had a mountain to cross, to which
all that we had hitherto seen was a mere joke.
The Afghans call the mountain the “Tooth-breaker”
(Dandan shikan). I don’t mind trifling adventures,
such as riding along the tops of walls, or foot-wide
bridges, but when it comes to riding an iron-shod
horse along smooth rock, slanting to a precipice of
unknown depth&mdash;well, it is past a joke. We had
to do it, and then descend a horrible “zig-zag.” I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
don’t call it a path, because the predominant features
were boulders, smooth tilted slabs, and rolling
pebbles. You lean back in the saddle, leaving your
horse to make his own arrangements. He picks
his way warily, lower and lower, and you thank
Heaven you have got so far, when, just as you reach
the end of one “zig,” and your horse’s nose is over
the edge, there is a crunching slip of his hind feet:
you catch in your breath and&mdash;think. But he does
not make a plunge over the edge, he pivots round on
his four feet, and goes down the “zag.” This
is repeated frequently, and at last, after many years,
you arrive with your nerves in a shattered condition
at the bottom. The next time I came over this road,
a year or two later, there were accidents; but that I
will speak of later.</p>

<p>We travelled on, day after day, through valleys
and over mountains&mdash;sometimes putting up at villages,
sometimes camping in our tents. Rain and hail
alternated with scorching heat. To blacken you
properly, you want a dry scorching heat, alternating
with icy winds and hail. Some of the soldiers looked
exactly as if they had been smoked: the eyelids and
creases of the face being white&mdash;the rest black.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Story of Ishak’s Rebellion.</div>

<p>We often had music when we camped, and one
evening I played chess with Jan Mahomed. He
beat me. We were then at Ghuzni guk, the valley
where the armies of the Amîr and of his cousin
Sirdar Ishak Khan met and fought. The story I
heard was this: His Highness the Amîr and Ishak
had always been friends, and when the Amîr ascended
the throne, Ishak was made Governor of the Turkestan
provinces. All went well for some years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Suddenly, news arrived in Turkestan that His Highness
had had an attack of gout, and had succumbed.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Ishak called his officers around him, and discussed
what steps to take. The chiefs urged him to seize
the throne. He, however, was a nervous man, not a
warrior by nature, and he hesitated. The chiefs
seeing this, broadly hinted that unless he seized the
moment while he could, they would place another on
the throne, and Ishak, much against his will, was
constrained to do as they wished. He sent his
women-folk and children across the Oxus into
Russian Turkestan, and marched with his troops and
chiefs for Kabul. They had not advanced many days’
journey when news was brought that the Amîr was
very much alive, and that his army was marching
under Gholam Hyder, the less, to meet them. Ishak
knew now that he must meet his Great Cousin, and
in fear and distrust he posted relays of horses, so
that, if the worst came, he could escape across the
frontier. They met in this valley a few miles beyond
Kamard. It is said that Ishak’s army at the outset
had the best of it&mdash;the men knew they were fighting
for their lives&mdash;but Ishak, neither Mahomedan nor
Christian, did not wait to see the end of the day. He
made use of his horses, and rapidly escaping across
the frontier into Russia, he left his unfortunate
followers to bear the brunt of the Amîr’s terrible
vengeance. It appears that the rumour of the Amîr’s
death had some foundation: His Highness had been
seized with a sudden attack of syncope, in which he
fell insensible to the ground.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>One Sunday we had a very long march, thirteen
hours, with two rests of an hour each. Going one
pace all the time is tedious, and one’s bones ache
abominably. We got into a ravine with a rapid
stream roaring along it, and part of the path was
undermined and slipping. We had to dismount and
skip across on foot, the soldiers getting the horses
over.</p>

<p>The ravine narrowed, curved to the right, and
opened out into a valley. The river roared round
the corner, figure <b>S</b> shape, in some places cutting
away the path completely. Our horses had to
plunge, and stumble, and splash through that river
three times in twenty yards, before we could get out
into the valley. It is at times like this that the
beautiful song “One More River to Cross” becomes
full of meaning. A mile or two more of hill and vale,
and soon after dark we reached “Tash Kurghán,”
or “Khulum,” the place where Lady Sale and her
companions in captivity were to have been taken.</p>

<p>We put up at the citadel or fort, which is built on
a rocky hill in the middle of the town. We rested
here all day Monday, and I enjoyed the luxury of a
hot bath. The Armenian waxed philosophical. He
said, “It is good to rest a little. Tired is go away,
and hungry is go away.” Also he suggested that a
shave might commend itself to my judgment.</p>

<p>“But who is to shave me?” I said.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wounded Soldiers in Tash Kurghán.</div>

<p>“There is bolber in the town.” He called it
barber afterwards. They fetched the barber, and I
wondered if it were dangerous for him to shave me,
for I had heard that Afghans were treacherous
fanatics. He did not destroy me. He merely rubbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
some oil on my chin and then scraped the skin off
with a knife&mdash;a painful process. When the operation
was completed, I was conducted to the hospital. No,
not on account of my chin, but to examine the patients.
The hospital was an ordinary but rather large dwelling-house,
and there were many wounded soldiers
lying there. It was exceedingly unclean and smelt
badly. The patients&mdash;I never before in my life saw
such a condition of things. The ghastly state to
which battle wounds can come from neglect and
improper treatment, is too awful for words. I wanted
to move the men from the house, and to amputate at
once some half-dozen arms and legs that were <em>worse</em>
than useless to their owners. I could not, for I had
neither knives nor chloroform, and I had to leave the
men&mdash;to leave them as I found them&mdash;with their
wistful eyes on me.</p>

<p>After that Jan Mahomed took me out to dine at
a local magnate’s house. My cook accompanied me,
bearing knife, fork, spoon, and plate. In the absence
of table and chair I had to kneel to use my knife and
fork. It was not a comfortable dinner. I could not
understand what the conversation was about; and
there were those men at the hospital ever before me.</p>

<p>Beyond Tash Kurghán we turned west, and the
scenery completely changed. For some miles there
was undulating plain covered with coarse grass. As
we rode on we started a herd of antelope, and had
a gallop after them: the change of motion from the
everlasting walk was a great rest to the muscles.</p>

<p>In one place the road dipped down between some
low clay hills, the defile of Abadu. Until very recently
this little grip had had the credit of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
exceedingly dangerous; in fact, it is even yet called
“the Valley of death:” this on account of the caravan
thieves and robbers who infested the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is less dangerous under the present Amîr, for I
had occasion while in Turkestan to send for two
additional dispensers from Kabul, and these two men
rode the whole distance from Kabul to Mazar
unattended. They had for safety’s sake a revolver.
It was, however, unloaded, and they had no powder.</p>

<p>The plains became gradually flatter and more
dusty, till, finally, it was little more than a desert with
the scantiest vegetation.</p>

<p>The heat was intense, and the glare from the
white dust most wearying. Away in the distance in
front of us, I saw a lake with some trees round it,
and I longed for the time when we should arrive and
get cool again in the shade. “There is no lake
there,” they said. Nonsense! I knew there was.
This was no “mirage.” I mean, you could see
the thing. There weren’t any towers or castles,
or people walking upside down, simply one or
two trees near some water. But, alas! we dragged
on and on in the parching heat, and never got
nearer the lake. We passed a camel, dead, by the
roadside, loading the hot air with foulness. The
gorged vultures only hopped lazily a little way
off, and sat and stared at us. We halted at last,
dismounted, and sat in the sun while the “chillim”
bearer blew up his charcoal and passed round the
pipe. I had a pull at it. He kept a little silver
mouthpiece for my especial benefit, which he slipped
on the end of the tube. I was glad of this, though
I knew it was simply done lest I had eaten pork or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
anything unclean. After all had smoked, the pipe
charcoal was used to light some sticks that the
pipe-bearer had brought with him; the kettle was
boiled, and we had hot tea&mdash;scalding hot: the
hotter it was, the more it seemed to satisfy our
thirst.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival at Mazar.</div>

<p>Then we mounted and rode on again. By-and-by,
Jan Mahomed politely gave me a handful
of English sweets, those round discs like pennies,
with a fancy edge, and with words printed on, “For a
good boy”: they tasted of peppermint. I wished
they had been gelatine lozenges. Some hours afterwards
we halted again. This time it was at a
village on the plain. There were small mud-huts,
and quaint-looking domes of wickerwork with bits
of scrub tucked into the interstices. It was cool
in the shade, and the villagers, Turkomans, gave
us lettuces to eat. It was delicious to crunch up
the cool crisp leaves. We drank more tea, then
rode on again amid the salaams of the Turkomans.
At last we came in sight of the trees, the cupola
and minarets of the town of Mazár-i-Sherif. This
was no phantom scene. A great crowd of people
on foot and on horseback came to meet us. I
noticed that many of them kissed the hand of Jan
Mahomed, those on horseback dismounting to do so.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
I also noticed that one man running by the side
of Jan Mahomed had a rifle slung backwards under
his arm, and that the barrel kept persistently in
a line with my head. It annoyed me. I could
not get out of the way of the brute. I need not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
have been disturbed, the gun was not in the least
likely to have been loaded: powder was too expensive.</p>

<p>We reached the town at five in the afternoon,
rode through the gate along the narrow bazaar to
the Palace. We dismounted under some big plane-trees
growing by a tank in the outer garden of
the Palace, and the report of our arrival was taken
to His Highness the Amîr. The pages and other
officials crowded round, busily brushed the white
dust off us, and brought us bowls of iced water.
Thirst! I knew what it was now! Ride for ten
hours over a dusty plain, with the thermometer over
100° in the shade, and anything you like in the sun,
and see.</p>

<p>Word was brought that His Highness would
receive us the next day. Jan Mahomed then handed
me over to the care of one of the court officials,
the “Ferash-Bashi,” or “Keeper of the Carpets.”
This was a short stout gentleman of few words,
and with a sour expression.</p>

<p>He was dressed rather gorgeously in a cashmere
tunic, gold-bedecked belt, trousers, high boots and
turban. When I got to know him better, I thought
he was not such a villain as he looked. This
gentleman conducted me, accompanied by the
Armenian, to a house near the Palace. We passed
through a covered porch, guarded by a pair of heavy
gates, into a garden surrounded by high walls:
went along the stone-paved paths, up some steps
into a suite of rooms on the north side of the
garden. The rooms were beautifully carpeted, and
looked very bright and handsome in the setting sun.
The “Bashi” informed us that he had orders to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
dinner from the Amîr’s kitchen; then politely saying
“Binishinēd”&mdash;take a seat&mdash;he departed. Seeing
there was no seat to take, I took the floor, and
waited hungrily till dinner should arrive. I had
not long to wait, and was delighted to see the
servants bring a portable chair and table, with the
dinner. I don’t remember what the different courses
were, but the dinner was European&mdash;soup, joint,
and entrées&mdash;and ended with a very delicious ice-pudding
and fruit.</p>

<p>This house, which His Highness was kind enough
to put at my service, is of interest. Here, His
Highness himself lived, before he built the Mazar
Palace. Here, too, Sirdar Ishak, in the days when
he was Governor of Turkestan, kept the ladies of
his harem; and here Amîr Shere Ali lived&mdash;and
died&mdash;in the very room I was dining in.</p>

<p>Amîr Shere Ali had been friendly with the
British: troubles arose, and he turned to the
Russians. The British occupied Quetta in 1876, and
in 1878 the Amîr received a mission from Russia.
A British mission being refused entry into the
Kyber, war was proclaimed. I need not trace
the outline of the war; it is enough to say that
Amîr Shere Ali did not receive the help he expected
from Russia, and he fled to Mazár-i-Sherif. Here
he was seized with his old enemy, gout&mdash;a disease
that is hereditary in this reigning family.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>They say that he was being attended by a
Russian physician, and that the pain being very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
severe the physician introduced some medicine
beneath the skin; then escaping by night to the
Oxus he crossed into Russian territory. In the
morning Amîr Shere Ali was found dead. For some
days his death was concealed, but finally the fact was
betrayed by a serving woman.</p>

<p>At once the soldiers of the regular army commenced
looting. The Palace was stripped; then the
bazaars and the wealthier people suffered, and soon
there was a pandemonium of riot, robbery, and
murder. This having occurred once, the fear is
lest it may occur again. Many of the well-to-do
natives of Afghanistan have that dread; and at the
time when the present Amîr was severely ill, in 1890,
there was such trepidation and anxiety in Kabul,
that many of the well-to-do concealed their more
portable valuables by burying them in the earth, and
sought for safer retreats outside the town, to which
they could hurry in time of need.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The House.</div>

<p>The house did not differ from those of the richer
Kabulis. The windowless twenty-feet-high walls,
in addition to ensuring privacy, enabled the occupant
on closure of the massive doors to convert his house
into a place of defence. It was partly overlooked,
however, by one tower or observatory built on the
top of a high house some little distance off. It was
here, I was informed, that Sirdar Ishak lived. He
could, therefore, catch a glimpse of the ladies of his
harem when they were walking on the roof.</p>

<p>The large square garden was filled with fruit-trees
and flowers: roses, wallflowers, sweet-williams; and
in the centre was a movable wooden platform. In
nearly every garden in Afghanistan you find, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
shady place, generally by the side of the stream that
ripples through the garden, a platform a foot or two
high, either of wood or carefully smoothed earth.
Here the Afghan, in his loose native garb, loves to
spread his carpet and sit in the hot summer afternoons
lulled by the murmur of the water, lazily talk
to his friends and drink unlimited tea. I have done
it myself.</p>

<p>On the north side were my rooms raised six steps
above the garden. Passing up the steps to the lobby
one entered the outer room with its seven arched
windows overlooking the garden, its one huge carpet
covering the floor, and, passing through, reached the
inner room, parallel and of the same size. There
were the white sparkling walls ornamented with frieze
and dado, the arched niches or takchahs, with small
mirrors between them, the fireplace with ornamental
mouldings, the draped ceiling and the smooth earth
floor with beautiful rugs that are usual in the homes
of the wealthiest Afghans. The inner room was lit
from the outer by a triple arched window, filled with
stained glass, which reached nearly to the floor. It
was in this room that Shere Ali died. It is said that
on the takchah over the fireplace there was left in
the hurry when Ishak fled, the sum of R80,000 in
gold. At any rate, while I was there, one of the
Court officials was fined heavily by the Amîr for
appropriating the money.</p>

<p>The rooms appointed to the interpreter and
servants adjoined mine, but were uncarpeted and
less elaborately ornamented. On the south side of the
garden the rooms were occupied by one of the chamberlains,
Mirza Abdur Rashid. The Mirza was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
excellent fellow, and we were friends during my
whole stay in Afghanistan. He was a pure-blooded
Afghan about my own age, with handsome features,
and a skin so dark as to be nearly black. For an
Afghan he was well educated, and it was his duty
night after night to read aloud to His Highness the
records of the kingdom and books translated into
Persian, of travel, geography, history, and general
information.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>On the east of the garden were rooms for the
Afghan bath, and on the west a colonnade where I
kept my horses and where the soldiers of the guard
congregated. Night and day a sentry was on duty in
the porch by the big gates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To be Presented.</div>

<p>On the appointed day I accompanied Jan Mahomed
Khan to the Palace, to be presented to His
Highness the Amîr. Mazar is a much smaller
town than Kabul, and as we had so short a distance
to go we walked. The bazaar and the streets bear a
strong resemblance, in their squalor and narrowness,
to those of the larger town; we, however, were on
the outskirts where the roads were wide and the
houses at intervals.</p>

<p>We reached the outer garden of the Palace,
where we had dismounted on our first arrival in
the town, and word was at once taken in to His
Highness. After waiting a few minutes the sentry
at the gate admitted us, and we entered the inner
garden. This appeared to be extensive, and was so
filled with almond and other fruit-trees as almost to
resemble a wood. Along by the paths were planted
sweet-smelling flowers. There were page boys and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
other officials walking about, and presently we came
in sight of the Palace. In front was a large open
space free from trees and flowers, and protected from
the sun by a crimson and white awning. This was
in place of a “Hall of Audience,” where congregate
those who have petitions to offer or disputes to settle.</p>

<p>Between the open space and the Palace ran
a stream of water about six feet wide, which
meandered through the garden. The Palace was
small. It resembled in style a bungalow, such as
one sees in India. There was a broad and high
verandah supported on carved wooden pillars, a
high sloping roof, and large windows on each
side of the centre door: the one on the left
reaching nearly to the ground.</p>

<p>We drew nearer, everyone making way, and we
saw, surrounded by pages and courtiers, that
remarkable man who, had he lived a century
ago, would in all probability have been, not the
petty prince of a half-barren country, but the great
conqueror of the East&mdash;“Amîr Abdurrahman, Amîr
of Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>He sat, a swarthy heavily-built man, with broad
white forehead and piercing eyes; his stooping
attitude, with head advanced, showed little of grace,
but seemed the personification of watchful strength;
as the full-lipped mouth and square jaw betokened
the inflexible will.</p>

<p>Almost Persian in type, with the aquiline semi-Jewish
features and coal-black hair of his race, he
added to the courtesy of the Oriental something
of the bluff heartiness of an Englishman.</p>

<p>We had crossed the stream by a foot-bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
but had paused at a little distance from His Highness.
Jan Mahomed receiving a sign, went quickly forward,
knelt at the feet of the Amîr, kissed his hand and
pressed it to his forehead and eyes; then, rising,
he presented me to His Highness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Questions asked by His Highness.</div>

<p>The Amîr welcomed me to his country, and courteously
expressed a hope that I was not fatigued by
the long and trying journey. A chair was placed,
and His Highness, desiring me to be seated, asked
me many questions as to my medical experiences.
In particular, he asked what opportunities I had
had of studying the disease, Gout&mdash;“neqris.” I
said that in Europe “gout” was called the
“English disease,” and that as all my professional
life had been spent in London, I had had many
opportunities of studying and treating this complaint.
His Highness then described to me the symptoms
that he suffered from, and showed me where the
pain seized him. He traced out exactly the course
of the sciatic nerve, and I saw that, whatever else
he might suffer from, there was no doubt whatever
that he had chronic sciatica. He asked also many
questions in Science and Natural History, with the
object, presumably, of testing one’s general knowledge.
He did not, however, enquire concerning
my Degrees or Diplomas in Medicine, though he
well knew of the existence of such things.</p>

<p>His Highness’s words were translated by an
Interpreter at the Court&mdash;a Hindustani who spoke
English exceedingly well. I confess I was glad
the Armenian was not, at that time, called upon
to perform this duty, or I am afraid my answers
would have been less to the point. However, later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the Armenian became very fluent, and I learnt to
understand him.</p>

<p>Seated some little distance from the Amîr
was another European, Captain (now Major) C. L.
Griesbach, C.I.E. This gentleman, I heard, had
been with the Amîr some two years as Geologist.
When my “examination” was satisfactorily over,
permission was given us to retire, and I accompanied
Captain Griesbach to his house and dined with him.
The Captain informed me he was not remaining much
longer with the Amîr, but was returning to India to
continue his service under the British Government.
After dinner he sketched the character of the Amîr,
and gave me a good deal of information as to the
life in Turkestan. He had heard of the terrible
punishment that had been inflicted on the rebel
followers of Sirdar Ishak and their unfortunate
families. One form of punishment appeared to have
been introduced from Russia. Men were described
as being tied, in the bitter winter of Turkestan,
naked, to a post; water was thrown over them, and
they were left to freeze: a strong man would last
two days. Girls had been fastened to the earth
and tortured; women and children sold as slaves&mdash;and
much more.</p>

<p>I came away in anything but a cheerful state of
mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Asiatic Motives from European Standpoint.</div>

<p>By whose orders had these things been done?
I asked myself. Who was responsible for them?
The Prince, whose service I had just entered? He
whom I was to attend in sickness; to the preservation
of whose health I was to devote all my knowledge
and skill? I tried to believe not; that the deeds had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
been done without his knowledge; that the stories
were exaggerated: anything than that they were
true; but the horror of it all remained with me long.
As the months went by, however, I perceived that to
view the conduct of an Asiatic ruler over a turbulent
country from the standpoint of Western nineteenth
century civilization, is to commit not only an error,
but an injustice. It is an error, for it leads
one to quite wrong conclusions as to the character of
the chief actor: the Amîr was simply proclaiming, in
language that Asiatics understand, his determination
of being king in Afghanistan. It is an injustice,
for education and civilization <em>cannot</em> advance with such
strides in an isolated Eastern country as in Europe;
and without the progress of knowledge the sons cannot
learn better than their fathers. Again, the Mahomedan
religion&mdash;does it uphold forgiveness, long-suffering,
pity, and humility, as virtues? On the contrary,
it claims an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.
It tends rather to encourage cruelty, for it spreads
its very tenets by slaughter. With what justice, then,
could I view these things from our Nineteenth
century standpoint, seeing that less than two
hundred years ago, with <em>our</em> religion, similar deeds
were committed among us.</p>

<p>A fortnight after my arrival, Captain Griesbach
departed for India. He was accompanied by the
Interpreter who had translated for me before the
Amîr: His Highness had desired the Interpreter to
remain in his service, but the man refused.</p>

<p>During the interview when I was presented,
His Highness had directed me to take charge
of the military hospital in Mazar. Remembering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
men in Tash Kurghán, I wondered what I should see.
Early in the morning I rode off, accompanied only
by the Armenian. His Highness had decided that
in Turkestan it was unnecessary for me to be
followed everywhere by a guard of soldiers. He
was my guard, he said, “and the Mazaris are
little likely to injure one for whose arrival they
have been anxiously watching.” One or two precautions
he directed the Armenian to take. He was
not to conduct me out on the plains more than
a mile from the city&mdash;this on account of Turkoman
highwaymen; nor near a gang of prisoners, for
they were dangerous men, and in spite of search
carried concealed weapons; nor near a regiment
of soldiers with fixed bayonets&mdash;for as he significantly
put it, “They have attempted even <em>my</em>
life!”</p>

<p>The way to the hospital was through the narrow,
covered bazaar or market-place. This was crowded
with people, and caravans of camels and pack-mules
from Kabul and Bokhara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Houses and Plains of Mazar.</div>

<p>The rough roofing of the bazaar forms a grateful
shelter from the scorching sun. The shops are
similar to those of Kabul. After the bazaar come
winding streets among the houses. Space here is
not so limited as in Kabul, and though the streets
are no wider, the houses are less lofty. In style
they differ much from the Kabul houses; generally,
the rooms are square, eight or nine feet high, with
a domed brickwork roof. One, two, or more rooms,
side by side, for master, servants, and horses, constitute
the house. Often there are no windows,
light being admitted through the door and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
an aperture in the centre of the domed roof. This
last acts also, when a wood fire is lighted, as a convenient
chimney. The sandali, however, is generally
used in the winter. The houses stand in an enclosed
yard or garden, but since the domed roofs of the
houses are not used for the promenade as are
those of Kabul, the garden-walls have no need to
be more than seven or eight feet high. This style
of house is peculiar to Turkestan, though there are,
in the suburbs of Mazar, many houses precisely like
those of Kabul. The walls, built of sun-dried bricks
and coated with mud, become painfully white and
glaring in the summer sun.</p>

<p>We reached one of the gates of the town and
rode out. Here, in the suburbs, are the summer
gardens of the richer men. Far away are the
mountains, blue in the distance. Mazar lies on
a malarious, almost desert plain in Turkestan, nine
miles east of the ancient city Balkh, and thirty
miles south of the Pata Kesar ferry, on the Oxus
river, so that we were near the Russian frontier.</p>

<p>The plain is desert, because of the absence of
water. When the snow melts in the warmth of
the spring, the plain becomes a blaze of red flowers,
wild tulips&mdash;poppies, my Interpreter said: but these
shrivel up and die in the summer. The gardens
of the town, and the fields immediately around it,
are irrigated by an artificial canal, made, I was
told, by the Amîr’s father during the few months
he reigned. They said the water was brought south
from the Oxus, but I fancy it must come from the
mountains towards Malmul.</p>

<p>The hospital, a short distance out of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
was once the suburban house and garden of a
wealthy man.</p>

<p>The patients lay in the garden: some were
under the trees, others were protected by long
thatched roofs supported on poles. None were in
the house. In Tash Kurghán the patients with
festering wounds were shut in a house when they
should have been out in the open. Here they were
out in the open, lying on the earth, and dying by
scores from malarial fever. They should have been
in the house, which was cool, and raised four or five
feet above the earth.</p>

<p>There were about three hundred patients when I
arrived, most of them down with severe Remittent
fever. The Hakims were treating the fever by
bleeding, purging, and starvation. Had they left the
men untreated some of them might have recovered:
as it was, the victims were being carried out five
and six a day. In spite of their want of success,
the Hakims continued blindly and persistently with
their mode of treatment.</p>

<p>I walked round examining the patients and
determining what I would do. Evidently it was
useless taking the poor fellows who were already
drained of their blood by the Hakims. I must take
the new comers if I was to succeed in the essential
object of medical treatment, that of curing the
patient. I therefore directed that all new comers&mdash;and
they poured into the hospital&mdash;should be taken
to the inner garden and their beds arranged in the
vacant rooms of the house there. A sentry was posted
at the gate of the inner garden, with orders to shoot
any Hakim attempting to enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>One room contained a heterogeneous collection of
European drugs and surgical instruments. In a
small room on the roof lived a Hindustani hospital
assistant&mdash;the gentlemanly dipsomaniac whom I have
already introduced. There were two other Hindustani
assistants, but they were utterly and hopelessly
ignorant. These men happily had spared the patients.
They had done no work at all.</p>

<p>I had, therefore, the first day seven or eight new
cases secluded from the rest under my own hands,
and, excluding bribery, beyond the reach of Hakims.
After some months, when I had become known, I
found whom I could trust, and did not take such
stringent precautions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afghan Appreciation of Medical Treatment.</div>

<p>I made a preliminary round of my cases with a
note-book, for, at that time, distinguish Mahomed
Akbar from Mahomed Hassan, and him from
Mahomed Hussain or Gul Mahomed, I could not. I
then made a second round with medicines, which
were administered before me; for the possibility of
bribery occurred to me, and I knew the Hakims
would shrink from nothing to bring discredit upon a
Feringhi interloper. My wards filled rapidly, and
for a week I had no deaths, the fever yielding
readily to quinine. The difference in the mortality
after European and after native treatment was
naturally striking, and the news spread far and
wide, especially among the soldiers, the poorer
townsfolk and the peasants, so that I soon had far
more work before me than I could possibly get
through in the day.</p>

<p>The way my time was allotted may be interesting.</p>

<p>After a light breakfast I galloped off to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hospital at daybreak, to escape the intense heat.
Having completed my rounds there I returned home
about eleven, washed and changed, putting on a dry
suit of flannel; then, lying on a couch in the inner
room, with all the doors and windows shut to keep
out the heat, I munched some of the most delicious
fruit&mdash;peaches, grapes, and melons&mdash;that it has ever
been my good fortune to taste. At this time I had
not become saturated with malaria, and I could eat
fruit without any evil resulting. I slept for an
hour, had lunch, and at two o’clock repaired to an
underground room, which was comparatively cool,
to see the patients, townsfolk, and soldiers who had
been gathering in crowds round the house. I
continued attending to them till six in the evening
and then ceased, whether there were many or few
remaining. After dinner I saw the one or two
favoured ones who had obtained from the Amîr a
special order for me to visit them at their homes.</p>

<p>I had at first some little trouble with the
Hindustanis. Work was uncongenial to them. Only
one of them, my friend the drunkard, had any
medical knowledge, even such preliminary attainment
as the use of the stethoscope. Of the other two, one
I made a compounder, and the other a dresser of
wounds.</p>

<p>Having one day to amputate a thumb, I desired
the dresser to remain at the hospital and administer
chloroform. He objected, saying he had finished
his work for the day. He did not understand
English, but spoke in Hindustani, in which language
my Armenian was fluent. I said several things,
more or less severe, which my interpreter trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>lated,
but the Hindustani went on his way. Had
I then been acquainted with Afghan customs I
should at once have ordered a soldier to thrash him,
but such a procedure would have been unprecedented
in a London hospital, and I did not do so. Instead,
I wrote to His Highness to enquire if I had
authority over the Hindustanis or not. His
Highness answered that I had authority over all
the Hindustanis and Hakims in the kingdom, with
the exception of three men&mdash;one Hindustani and
the two chief Hakims. He added, that if there
were any insubordination I was at liberty to order
the offender to be whipped or put in irons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Two Chief Hakims.</div>

<p>The Hindustani over whom I had no authority
was a qualified man, who had been hospital assistant
in the British Army, but who, accused of murdering
his superior officer, an Englishman, had escaped into
Afghanistan. The Amîr found him a beggar by
the wayside and took him into his service, appointing
him to attend to the slaves of the harem. He was
at the time of which I am writing, in Kabul. The
Hakims who were excepted were two old men who
had attended the Amîr’s father. One, the Mirza
Abdul Wahid, was an interesting old man, with
wrinkled face of a Roman type. I read of him in
a Russian book that Captain Griesbach lent me.
For a Hakim he was an intelligent man, and I had a
respect and a liking for the courtly old fellow. He
died while I was in Turkestan, and I went to see
him shortly before his death. With a courtesy that
pained me he rose from his sickbed and ordered
tea and sweetmeats to be brought.</p>

<p>The other Hakim, Abdul Rashid, was a fat old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
fool, pompous and ignorant, with many words. He
came to see me&mdash;but I will relate that presently.
The chair he sat on never recovered. It was
rickety ever afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hindustani Intrigue.</div>

<p>I knew now what my powers were. The
Hindustanis did not openly rebel again, but they
hatched a plot which, had they been more careful,
might have led to unpleasant results. First, as I
afterwards heard, one of them, the one whom I had
made compounder, appealed to the Amîr for protection.
I was his enemy, he said. <em>His</em> enemy! But the
Amîr waited and watched. It <em>might</em> be true, India
is a conquered country. His Highness appeared to
take but little notice of me. He was courteous as
always, and allowed me to be seated in his presence;
but he spoke very little to me. The Hindustani,
however, marred his own plot, for, not content with
opposing me, he needs must quarrel with his countrymen
instead of standing by them. He made a false
accusation against the “dresser,” who, on his part,
made a countermove. They were arrested and
brought before the Amîr, each swearing a contradiction
to the other. They were both put to the torture&mdash;the
“wedge and post”&mdash;and the compounder,
screaming with fright, gave in at once and confessed.
He was dismissed the service.</p>

<p>He knelt, imploring pardon and permission to
stay; but the Amîr said, “I send you away for your
own good. Twice you were taken in adultery, and,
as a foreigner, I spared you. Now you falsely accuse
and endeavour to ruin your own countryman. Go,
before I kill you.”</p>

<p>I think I have not described the “wedge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
post.” It is a simple thing. There is an upright
post in the earth. The criminal is seated on the
ground and his feet lashed to the post; wedges are
inserted between the sole of the foot and the post,
and are hammered home. It is a painful process,
they say, but a dogged Afghan will sit till the bones
of both feet are crushed, before he will utter a
sound.</p>

<p>The Hindustani before he departed came to take
leave of me&mdash;his enemy! the coachman is not an
enemy to the horses. I gave him some tea and sent
him away, but I noticed he did not limp; he must
have given in soon at the post.</p>

<p>Then the other one, the dresser, linked the
drunkard with him, and they aimed, not at me,
but at the Armenian. They would cut him off.
Now this fellow had been honest according to his
lights. Every piece of advice he gave me I found
to be sound: he instructed me in the customs
of the country, described what should be done at
festivals, what at visits of condolence; told me who
were the dangerous men and who the true servants
of His Highness; prevented my servants robbing
me, and though he was rough and unpolished he
had showed to me in a hundred minor ways a
careful thought almost amounting to affection.
Added to this, his dry humour and his yarns in
broken English had whiled away many a dull hour
when, as a newcomer, the sense of utter loneliness
had oppressed me. He seemed my one friend. Was
I to go back on him?</p>

<p>The Hindustanis wrote to His Highness accusing
the Armenian, among other things, of translating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the Amîr’s words to me falsely&mdash;a most serious
matter. But how could they know the Armenian
translated falsely if they did not understand
English? The drunkard understood, though he
spoke “book English,” and haltingly; hence the
necessity of him in the plot.</p>

<p>I saw the Armenian one day looking very
dejected, and I asked him what was the matter. He
told me of the accusation that had just been made
against him.</p>

<p>“Perhaps Amîr Sahib kill me,” he said.</p>

<p>Wishing to cause him as much distress as
possible, the Hindustanis had shown their hand. It
was a weak thing to do. The original conception
was crafty, for I saw at once how difficult a thing
it was to rebut; and then, too, it was just the idea
to “catch on” in the mind of an Oriental monarch.
How could I say the Armenian translated correctly
when I understood little or no Persian?</p>

<p>If anything was to be done it must be done
promptly. I determined, therefore, to carry the
war into the enemy’s camp, and I sat down at once
and wrote to His Highness in English.</p>

<p>I said it had come to my ears that these men&mdash;mentioning
their names&mdash;had accused my Interpreter
of translating falsely; that I had no reason to
believe the accusation was true, for I found the
accusers unworthy of trust. I then proceeded to
explain why; describing the drunkenness of the one
and the ignorance of the other; and pointed out
their neglect of duty, naming a man of position as
witness in each case that I brought forward. I was,
fortunately, able to do this, for in two or three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
surgical operations that I had had to do, when they
showed themselves neglectful and incompetent, there
had been men of position, military officers, who
witnessed the operation. I sent for the secretary of
Col. Attaullah Khan, then British agent with the
Amîr, who understood English, asked him to
translate for me, mentioning in the letter that he
had done so, and at once sent the translation in to
His Highness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amîr’s Sense of Justice.</div>

<p>That night the Amîr sent for the witnesses and
examined them. The next morning a messenger
arrived with a written order from the Amîr that
I was to bring the Armenian before him on the
following day; the Hindustanis were to be accompanied
by one of their countrymen, or rather a
Kashmiri, who spoke English fluently. This man
was a civil engineer who had served the Amîr
for some eight years&mdash;a clever man, well known at
the Foreign Office in India.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>I felt some amount of nervous disturbance, wondering
what turn the affair might take. I had not been
long in the country, and I did not know what were
the possibilities of the case. The whole story of
the Hindustanis is, in itself, unimportant. What
does it matter whether they rebelled against me
or not? But it brings forward one trait of the
Amîr’s character&mdash;his sense of what is fair&mdash;and
for that reason I have related it.</p>

<p>The morning came.</p>

<p>The Armenian, with a white face, silently walked
with me to the Palace. It was a sunny warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
morning, the fruit-trees in the garden were in
full bloom, and I remember the scent of the flowers,
as we walked along the path. How is it, I wonder,
that slight external impressions dwell for ever in
one’s memory when the mind is busily turned
inwards? The awning was not up, and we took
our stand, the Armenian and I, in the sun on the
open space opposite the Palace. The two Hindustanis
came up looking very yellow, accompanied
by the Kashmiri, who was an intelligent looking
man, with a dark skin. We waited a few minutes
without speaking, and then His Highness with
some attendant pages came from the Palace, and
took his seat on an arm-chair on the verandah,
opposite to us. The natives “salaamed,” I bowed,
and His Highness touched his hat in acknowledgment.
His Highness then addressed the Kashmiri
engineer in Persian. The engineer turned to me,
he had my letter in his hand; and he said in a
severe manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have here a letter purporting to be from you.
I notice that it is not dated.”</p>

<p>“Confound your impudence,” I thought, but I
said nothing; I bowed.</p>

<p>“You know,” said he, approaching nearer and
altering his manner, “that this Armenian fellow
cannot speak English, you had very much better&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Who asked for your advice, sir!” I said,
turning on him suddenly. “His Highness ordered
you to enquire whether that letter were mine or
not.” This was a shot, for when His Highness
spoke, I understood only two words, “letter” and
“doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The engineer appeared startled, and he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A learned man like yourself, the most scientific
in Afghanistan, and one on whose shoulders a grave
responsibility rests, should have his words translated
exact in every detail. If you expressed a wish to
that effect, I am sure His Highness would engage
from India at a large salary, an interpreter&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>At it again, I thought.</p>

<p>“That is my letter, sir. Inform His Highness.”
There appeared nothing more to be said, and he
turned to the Amîr and addressed him in Persian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Courtier’s Influence.</div>

<p>Then His Highness burst forth. I did not
understand his words, but there was no mistaking
his manner&mdash;the knitted brow, the flashing eye
and the low rumble, lashing up to a roar. The
storm descended upon the heads of the two Hindustanis.
They stood shivering, and from yellow
became green. <em>They</em> knew, and I afterwards had
frequent opportunities of observing, that in moments
like this the Amîr is dangerous; men’s lives tremble
in the balance. A clever man who has the entrée
of the Durbar, and who happens to be in favour, may
sometimes on these occasions, by dropping a word
here and edging in a sentence there, gradually
turn the current of the Amîr’s thought. If he can
also by some appropriate witticism bring about a
relaxation of the muscles of that grim face, causing
a smile or perhaps a laugh, then a man’s life is
saved. They, however, more often employ their wits
in adding fuel to the fire.</p>

<p>The Hindustanis crept away, and I was about
to bow and retire, when His Highness signed to
me to stop. I was then informed that breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
was prepared under the almond trees in the garden,
and His Highness desired my company.</p>

<p>This was the first occasion on which the Amîr
showed me any act of familiar kindness, and my
relief from suspense was such, that in attempting to
describe the breakfast I can hardly do full justice to
the situation. The air was balmy, as we sat in
the shade of the blossoming trees. Sweet-scented
flowers were at our feet, and I sat sipping tea
and munching macaroons in the luxurious enjoyment
of living. The Armenian stood silently behind my
chair, and I fancy he too, though in a more realistic
sense than I, felt the luxurious enjoyment that mere
life could afford.</p>

<p>His Highness spoke to me for some time, though I
remember but little of the conversation, except
the more full description His Highness gave of his
bodily ailments. He did not yet ask me to prescribe
for him.</p>

<p>When we reached home, I found my neighbour
opposite, the Mirza Abdur-Rashid, had a guest. They
were drinking tea together in the garden, and invited
me to join them. The guest was a tall, very handsome
man, plainly dressed in grey military tunic and
astrakhan hat. He had very considerable dignity
of manner, and was, I found, the Sirdar Gholam
Hussain, a relative of His Highness, of the same clan.
It is the duty of this gentleman to wait upon the
Amîr at dinner, and to take charge of all food
laid before His Highness. It is an honourable and
also an onerous task in a country where the danger
of poison is ever before the King. The drinking
water of His Highness is in charge of a trusted page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the foster-brother of one of the Princes, and when,
some time after this, I was attending His Highness
medically, this page it was who was entrusted with
the keys of the medicine cabinet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blind Singer.</div>

<p>As we chatted over our tea, a blind boy came into
the garden to sing. He would have been much
improved by a few lessons on voice production, but
for all that we listened to him with pleasure. His
voice was soft and sweet, with a pathetic ring in it.</p>

<p>A few days after this I was sent for to see General
Nassir Khan, who was sick. He was a bent old
man, but had been, I heard, a tiger to fight. He
was with the Amîr during His Highness’s exile
in Asiatic Russia. They said that he entered the
Russian service, and rose to the rank of Colonel.
He did not, however, forget his master, for he sent
the greater part of his pay to the Amîr, retaining
only enough for bare necessaries. Concerning this
old man, I heard a little story, which throws a
side-light on the Amîr, and may therefore be
interesting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Story of the Shield.</div>

<p>There had been brought to His Highness, as
a present, a very beautiful shield inlaid with gold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
This was when he had come to the throne, and
was Amîr.</p>

<p>Everyone in the Durbar Hall feasted his eyes
upon this beautiful thing, and the courtiers edged
anxiously nearer the royal chair, in the hope that
“Amîr Sahib” might perhaps, as he sometimes did,
bestow a present upon a “faithful and deserving
slave.” The Amîr slowly cast his eyes round the
ring, and each heart beat high, as the Amîr’s eyes
rested a moment on this man or that. Suddenly,
the Amîr called out,</p>

<p>“Nassir, Pesh biár,” “come forward.”</p>

<p>Out of a far corner came Nassir. The Amîr
turned to the anxious circle, and said,</p>

<p>“Look upon this man. He was with me in
Samarcànd.” The hearts of the courtiers sank;
Nassir, then, was to be the recipient of the shield.</p>

<p>“He was with me in Samarcànd, and for a little
thing he turned and cursed me. These were his
words”&mdash;and the Amîr repeated the curse. “Is
this so?” he said to Nassir. The old man hung
his head in shame.</p>

<p>“He cursed me; he half drew his sword on me,
his master. What is this man worthy of?”</p>

<p>There was a dead silence: the shield was forgotten,
for behold Nassir’s day had come. It had;
but not in the sense anticipated.</p>

<p>“Give him the shield,” said the Amîr. “He was
with me in Samarcànd.”</p>

<p>I should finish the story by saying Nassir treasured
the shield as the apple of his eye, and shewed it
me with honest pride&mdash;but no, he sold it next day
for what it would fetch. Afghanistan!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>When I went to see him he was suffering from
lumbago. He was a courtly old man, and he
gave me black tea to drink, in a Russian tea-glass.</p>

<p>I saw him at the Court, some time afterwards, and
he came up to speak to me. He had a stoop in
his shoulders, and the tailor had not cut his tunic
properly, so that he had unbuttoned the top two
or three buttons to release his throat. It was a
gorgeous tunic, richly embroidered with gold; his
sword-belt and scabbard were loaded with plates of
solid gold, and he had an old-fashioned bowler hat,
too large for him, on the back of his head. I was
sorry. It took so from the dignity of his appearance;
at least in my eyes: not so in the eyes of the
Afghans, to them it was quite <i>en règle</i>.</p>

<p>Shortly after my visit to the general, I developed,
from being constantly among the sick, a “Hospital
throat,” and had to stop at home for a day or two.
His Highness sent me a very kind message of condolence;
and while I was at home there was brought
to me, from the Post Office, a post card written in
French and addressed to the “Postmaster-General,
Afghanistan.” The Amîr wished to know what was
written. I found the card came from the Postmaster
of some small Belgian town. It was a proposal
on his part to the Postmaster-General of
Afghanistan to exchange “stamps.” He was, he
explained, a “stamp collector.” With the help of
the Armenian I sent a Persian translation to His
Highness. The Amîr directed me to write and
enquire what was the colour of the stamps the collector
required: on receipt of his answer they would
be forwarded to him. I imagine His Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
considered that the collection was more for artistic
effect than on account of the intrinsic value of the
stamps. The Belgian received his stamps in due time.</p>

<p>Just at this time, too, I received a letter from the
Editor of one of the Indian papers asking me to
contribute a series of articles on Afghanistan. As,
however, I was in the service of the Amîr I did not
feel justified in doing so, and was compelled to leave
the letter unanswered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Escape of Allah Nûr.</div>

<p>Another incident also occurred. There was in
the Hospital a soldier named Allah Nûr. He was
suffering from disease of the elbow, which had
advanced to such a degree that the joint was completely
disorganized. The Hakims had promised
to cure him by the application of ointments. I
explained to him, however, that this was impossible,
and that the only remedy was to remove the arm.
Poor Allah Nûr had been ill a long time: he was
much reduced by pain and constant discharge, and he
begged me from day to day to postpone the operation.
He explained his dread of the knife, of which he
seemed ashamed, by calling attention to his pitiable
state of weakness. When I was laid up with my
throat he seized the opportunity one night to make
his escape from the Hospital: he got on a donkey
which some kind friend had provided, and managed to
reach a place called Takh-ta-Pul, some three or four
miles off, before he was captured.</p>

<p>The next morning he was brought back and taken
before the Amîr. His Highness said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A child or a fool is he who runs from his
Physician.”</p>

<p>He sent for a probe and proceeded to examine
the joint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“Without doubt the limb must come off,” said he.</p>

<p>“Barâie Khuda!” said Allah Nûr.</p>

<p>“Be silent!” said the Amîr.</p>

<p>“For God’s sake, do not. My Lord&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Amîr reached out his Royal hand and boxed
his ear. Allah Nûr was conducted back to the
Hospital. That afternoon, my throat being better, I
attended the military Durbar. His Highness discussed
with me the case of Allah Nûr, advising amputation.</p>

<p>“It would appear wise, however,” said he, “considering
the man’s condition of weakness, to postpone
the operation for a few days, feeding him meanwhile
on strong soups and administering ‘Portwein.’”</p>

<p>I need not say that I entirely concurred.</p>

<p>His Highness then spoke of other matters. He
explained why he walked so little and was carried
from place to place in his palanquin. It was on
account of the pain he suffered from chronic sciatica.
The horses reserved for his riding were chosen for
their steadiness, and he had ordered them to be led
about the streets after dark to cure them of any habit
they might have of shying. In moving, even from one
chair to another, he found the assistance of a walking-stick
necessary. He spoke also very kindly to me
concerning my professional work, and finally asked me
to visit an old friend of his who was sick&mdash;the Hadji
Jan Mahomed.</p>

<p>Things were going well with me evidently, for
directly the Durbar was over the Commander-in-Chief
in Turkestan came up to speak to me and we walked
out of the Palace gardens hand-in-hand:&mdash;I hate
walking hand-in-hand with a man. He was very
chatty, and asked me to visit a Colonel of his who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
ill. The name of the Turkestan Commander-in-Chief
was Gholam Hydar, but he was a man of a much
smaller frame than his namesake the Commander-in-Chief
in Kabul. Also he bore a most startling
resemblance to Dr. Lauder Brunton, F.R.S., the
London Physician. No two brothers could be more
alike. They were the same build. The very beard
and moustache were trimmed in the same fashion.
The only difference I could see was that Dr. Brunton
is fair and the Suparsalar Gholam Hydar Khan was
dark. I had, therefore, from the beginning a pre-disposition
in favour of Gholam Hydar on account of
his resemblance to my former teacher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Operation on Allah Nûr.</div>

<p>The next morning on arriving at the Hospital I
found Allah Nûr only too ready to have his arm
amputated. While he had been away from the
Hospital the flies in that hot climate had found access
to the sore, and there were maggots squirming about
in the joint. It was very horrible. There was no
postponing the operation now.</p>

<p>We had no operating table, and Allah Nûr was laid
on a mound of earth in the shade of a tree in the
garden. I arranged the instruments near and took
off my turban lest it should obstruct my view at a
critical moment. I put the man under chloroform,
screwed up the tourniquet, and ordered the Armenian
to hold the arm steady. There were two or three
sweeping cuts, the grate of the saw, and the arm was
off midway between shoulder and elbow.</p>

<p>The Afghans in the Hospital made an interested
ring of spectators. One of the Hindustanis, however,
nearly fainted, and the Armenian said:</p>

<p>“Sir, I very glad you quick, my head is go round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
and round, and my eye is like I drink a bottle of
brandy and a bottle of rum mixed&mdash;all is blood!” I
did not ask him to help in an operation again.</p>

<p>After dressing the stump and seeing that Allah
Nûr had recovered properly from the chloroform and
was comfortable, I rode off to see His Highness’s old
friend, the Hadji Jan Mahomed.</p>

<p>I found that the Hadji lived in a typical
Turkestan house in the outskirts of the town. There
was the row of isolated dome-shaped rooms or houses
side by side, and in front a large garden almost
entirely covered with grape vines. These ran along
ridges of earth about six feet apart, each being some
three feet high and six feet wide.</p>

<p>The Hadji was a venerable-looking old fellow of
about seventy, with a long white beard. He was of
the same tribe as His Highness&mdash;the Barakzai Durani.</p>

<p>After tea and fruit had been brought, and we had
had some general conversation, the Hadji informed me
that he had lately arrived from Bokhara, and was
suffering from a disease of the leg that is prevalent in
that district. On examination I found he was suffering
from “Guinea worm,” a thread-like creature some two
or three feet long, that burrows through the tissues
of the body, generally infesting the feet and legs.
The treatment adopted at the present day is the same
as that pursued by the old Persian surgeons, who
extracted the worm by gentle and continuous traction,
winding the exposed end of the worm round a small
stick of ivory, bone or wood. If the worm is broken,
local and even severe constitutional mischief is apt to
ensue, and this is what had happened to the Hadji.
The attempt to extract the worm had been unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
it had been broken. He had been
exceedingly ill, he said; and I found a large burrowing
chronic abscess above the right knee. It was a
troublesome case, and I visited him several times.
At last, one day I had the good fortune to detect
the broken end of the worm, and with the greatest
gentleness and care managed to extract it. The
leg then soon healed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Haughty Colonel.</div>

<p>After I had visited the Hadji, who, by the way,
presented me with half a pound of Orange Pekoe,
I went to see the young Colonel whom the Commander-in-Chief
had asked me to visit. His house
was not very far from the Palace gardens, and I
found him seated on a charpoy under the trees in
his garden: one or two friends and a Hakim sat
with him. He was a small dark man with a haughty
expression, but he looked very ill. He had had
fever, but was now suffering from suppuration of the
parotid, so that he had a great unbroken abscess
in his cheek and neck.</p>

<p>I examined him carefully and decided that the
abscess should be opened without delay. He did not,
however, view the suggestion with any favour. He
told me, very politely, that he should prefer applying
certain ointments that had been advised by his friend
the Hakim. I do not remember the name of the
Hakim. He was one of the minor practitioners
whom I really never took note of.</p>

<p>The Colonel also explained that should the ointment
not have the desired effect, he would wish to try
the efficacy of prayer. After this, what was there to
be said? I bowed, refused the tea he politely offered,
and begged permission to withdraw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming away I said to the Armenian:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What infernal nonsense it is calling me to fellows
like that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the Armenian, “he is fool man.
And that Hakim! he is nothing. His <em>father</em> cannot
sit in your presence.” This was soothing, perhaps.
As we were going home I met little Mahomed Omer,
son of Perwana Khan, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief
in Kabul. He was a bright little lad of about
thirteen. His face was distinctly of the Tartar type.
We grew very friendly, and he often came with his
tutor or “Lala” to see me. I gave him my felt hat,
and he walked about proudly with it over his ears.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Day at Takh-ta-Pul.</div>

<p>Soon after this I went to Takh-ta-Pul, the place
where my friend Allah Nûr had escaped to, in order
to inspect the hospital there. The Commander-in-Chief
sent a Captain&mdash;Seyd Hussain&mdash;a huge Afghan
hillman, some six feet three inches high, to accompany
me, so one morning he and I and the Armenian and
some servants rode off together. Seyd Hussain was
quite a friend of mine; he came very often to see me,
and afterwards said such polite things, that the
Commander-in-Chief used to call him my “son.”
We took about an hour over our ride: it was so
excessively hot. When we arrived at Takh-ta-Pul, I
called upon the Commander-in-Chief, who was there
for a few days, had tea with him, and was then
conducted to a house prepared for me. I was shown
into an upper chamber, carpeted and decorated, which
overlooked the garden, a large square one with trees
and flowers, and commanded a view of the town and
the distant mountains.</p>

<p>My “son” came too, and five or six others, including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the Armenian, to amuse me. They sang songs, told
stories, and the captain read my future in the palm of
my hand: I was surprised to find palmistry an Afghan
accomplishment. He told me I should have two
severe illnesses in the country, but should return to
my native land in safety. We had grapes and tea,
and, at about one o’clock, tiffin or lunch. There was
roast mutton, I remember, exceedingly oily, which
one of my servants, the groom, had cooked for me.
This gentleman, whom I had picked up&mdash;or rather the
Armenian had picked up for me&mdash;in Turkestan, was a
Peshawuri. He had been a policeman in Burma, he
said. He also said he could make a pudding; and he
did, a watery rice pudding. Then a pillow was
brought, and I lay on the floor and slept for an hour.
After that we had more songs and stories, and at six,
when the heat of the day had gone, I called again on
the Commander-in-Chief and had more tea. He
wished me to stay the night, but I remembered I
had not inspected the Hospital yet, besides, for all I
knew, the Amîr might want me. I decided therefore
not to stop.</p>

<p>We started off for the Hospital, which was
a little way out of the town. It was precisely like
that of Mazar, except that there were only five
or six patients in it. These were looked after by a
Hakim. In the evening the Captain, the Armenian,
and I rode back to Mazar, and I prepared my report
for the Amîr. One thing I often regret: it is that I
did not at this time act on the Armenian’s suggestion
and ride to the ancient city Balkh, which was
only some six or seven miles beyond Takh-ta-Pul.
However, I had the feeling that I had taken a day off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
at Takh-ta-Pul, and must not waste any more time
when there were so many sick waiting for treatment.
Balkh, “the mother of cities,” is situated in a province
capable of great cultivation, and was a flourishing
city in the time of Alexander the Great. The
population, however, was so nearly exterminated by
Ghengis Khan, and again by Tamerlane and his
successors, that it is doubtful whether it will ever
again recover even a moiety of its former importance.</p>

<p>There is at Mazar-i-Sherif a great Mosque or
Temple, from which the town takes its name. It is
a huge ornate building with minarets, and a lofty
cupola built of a shining blue stone. It is held
in veneration by all Mussulmans, but more especially
by the sect of Shiahs. The Mosque contains a
tomb which is supposed to be that of Ali, son-in-law
of Mahomed, though some European authorities
consider that Ali was buried near Baghdad. Be
that as it may, the Mosque possesses considerable
revenues, the gifts of wealthy votaries and other
pious people, which are used to feed the crowds of
indigent pilgrims who, at certain times in the year,
flock in great numbers to Mazar. Moreover, the
remains of Ali, or whoever the gentleman may be,
are capable of working miracles of no mean order.
They restore sight to the blind, hearing to the
deaf, and health to the sick. During one of the
religious festivals which occurred while I was in
Turkestan, there were no less than five men whose
sight had been restored by their pilgrimage to the
Mosque! I know this is true, for the Amîr told
me so himself!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Cool-air Pavilion.</div>

<p>One morning His Highness sent for me to
examine his ear. He fancied he had some insect
in it. This was in July, and the weather was very
hot. I found His Highness seated in a small
circular pavilion in the Palace garden. I had often
wondered what this little building was. It was a
cool-air chamber. There was a door and one
window. This window was filled in with interlaced
branches of an aromatic shrub; water from
a gutter trickled over the lattice work, and a current
of air was driven in by a paddlewheel fan, which
a man outside worked with a handle. I was
ushered into the semi-darkness of the room; I
bowed, and a chair was placed midway between the
door and the window in an awful draught. After
the hot dry air of the outside this horrible little
room felt like an ice well. I literally shivered, and
there sat His Highness in the full draught, and,
what is most unusual, without a head covering.</p>

<p>It was too dark in the Pavilion to see the
condition of the ear, and His Highness at once consented
to come out into the open. A chair was
brought, and His Highness sat with bare head in
the blazing sun. “Surely there is danger of sunstroke,”
I thought.</p>

<p>I begged permission to put on my helmet,
saying I was afraid of the sun. I thought His
Highness might then cover his own head; no,
he did not seem to mind the heat. I examined
the ear with the speculum and found nothing in it.
He had, however, a slight catarrh of the throat
and of the Eustachian tube leading from the throat
to the inner ear. I pointed out the danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
exposing the body while the skin is acting freely
to a draught of cold damp air; and indicated the
line of treatment I should adopt if I were to attend
to the ear. His Highness coincided with my views,
said that he had the medicines I spoke of, and
should certainly try them. It struck me that all
he wanted really was to know if there were anything
in his ear: he had not asked me to prescribe
for him.</p>

<p>I heard that His Highness spoke highly of me
after I left. I think he was not yet prepared to place
himself entirely in my hands, and I had not forced
him into the uncomfortable position of having to
refuse my treatment and, therefore, appear somewhat
discourteous.</p>

<p>There is, in this part of Turkestan, a disease
which bears a strong resemblance to the so-called
Delhi boil&mdash;or, more correctly, Delhi ulcer. It was
exceedingly prevalent while I was in Turkestan,
and after trying various remedies ineffectually I hit
upon one which had a marked beneficial effect.
Formerly, the ulcers&mdash;which appear on the exposed
parts of the body, the hands, feet, and face&mdash;were
very intractable and rarely healed in less than a
year. Under the popular native treatment they
sometimes attained enormous proportions, and became
covered with most exuberant granulations&mdash;great
mounds of proud flesh: now they healed
rapidly in a month, or less, according to the size, so
that I gained a sort of reputation in this line. One
day the British Agent, Colonel Attaullah Khan, sent
his Secretary to ask me to visit him, as he was
suffering from one of these sores upon his heel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
his own Hindustani medical attendant had been
unsuccessful in giving him relief.</p>

<p>I said, certainly, I would come, and was pulling
on my boots, when the Armenian said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, please you kind, a little you wait.”</p>

<p>“What for?” said I, with a boot half on.</p>

<p>“First, I write to Amîr Sahib and ask; then you
go or you not go, as he says. You Amîr Sahib’s
servant.”</p>

<p>“Well, but&mdash;&mdash;” However, I thought there was
no harm in his writing at any rate, and I waited.
His Highness’s answer arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Answer.</div>

<p>He acknowledged the receipt of my letter of
such a date, in which I asked&mdash;Had I the Royal
permission to visit&mdash;and so on. He was deeply
grieved on account of the illness of the Sirdar, for
whom he had the greatest affection and respect,
but there were weighty matters to consider. I,
though an Englishman, was his servant. If, through
an unforeseen calamity God should strike the Sirdar,
while under my medical care, with an illness more
severe than the present one, or, God forbid, even
with death, then the honourable Government of
England might consider in their wisdom that I, his
servant, instigated by evil men, had worked harm
upon the Sirdar.</p>

<p>The gist of it was, that whatever His Highness’s
reason might be, he did not wish me to attend the
Agent. I therefore sent my apologies. At the next
Durbar His Highness appeared pleased that I had
asked his permission before visiting the Agent, and he
entered more fully, though on the same lines, into his
reasons for refusing permission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon a Brigadier named Hadji Gul Khan,
with his Staff, called upon me at my house. They all
came in, about a dozen of them, and the Brigadier, in
a hearty sort of way, shook hands and asked how I
was. I was surprised, as he was quite a stranger to
me, though it is possible I was not so to him. He
was a relative of the Amîr’s, a Barukzai Durani:
he had called to ask if I would attend to one of his
soldiers who had a disease of the leg. I said,
“With pleasure, which is he?”</p>

<p>“This is the man.”</p>

<p>I examined him, and found he had a fatty tumour
on the outer side of the right thigh. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“It will be necessary to remove this swelling with
the knife. It consists of a mass of fat.”</p>

<p>“Bisyar khôb,” said the Brigadier; “very good;
remove it.”</p>

<p>“Kai?” said I. “When?”</p>

<p>“Hala,” said he. “Now.”</p>

<p>“Certainly; come into the other room,” for I did
not want to spoil my beautiful carpets. I was short
of chloroform, and I said to the Armenian,</p>

<p>“Tell the man I shall hurt him.” The man said,</p>

<p>“Khair ast, it is nothing. Tell the Doctor Sahib,
if he cut me to pieces I shall not speak.”</p>

<p>“O, all right,” I said, “tell him to lie on the
ground.” He lay down. I made a longitudinal incision
over the tumour, and proceeded to dissect it out.
It must have been very painful, but the man said
nothing, neither did I; but the bystanders, when
the mass of yellowish white fat appeared between
the edges of the wound, exclaimed, “Wah! wah!”
in excited admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>I bandaged the leg, and the soldier walked back to
his barracks. He had to be in bed, however, for some
time afterwards. We were very good friends after
that&mdash;the soldier and I. I am sure I don’t know
why, except that I admired his pluck, and had hurt
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Country Cousin among the Court Pages.</div>

<p>I called on the Hadji Jan Mahomed again, and
found his young son there. Both the Hadji and his
son kept to the pure Afghan costume, with the turban
and picturesque flowing robes. The boy afterwards
became a Court Page, but he looked very out of place
among the Europeanized youngsters who swaggered
about at the Palace. He looked out of date and
countryfied in his robes, and he felt it. I noticed
when I was at the Hadji’s what beautiful feet he and
his son had: they were like the feet of a Greek statue.
The toes had shape. They were not degenerated like
ours, by descent through a boot-wearing ancestry.</p>

<p>One of the Pages lived next door to me; he was
an ugly little beggar, but rather amusing, and the
Armenian suggested one evening, to while away an
hour, that we should go and see him. He was hard
at work puzzling over Euclid. It seemed very odd to
see the well-known diagrams in the midst of Persian
writing. We played cards&mdash;a sort of three-handed
whist&mdash;and other games. They taught them to me,
but I have completely forgotten how they were played.
The cards used were just the same as those we have,
except that they were cheap ones, made in Germany,
and were exceedingly dirty.</p>

<p>Another Page-boy lived opposite; next door to the
Mirza Abdur Rashid. He was an exceedingly pretty
boy, and was, in consequence, very gorgeously dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
in a scarlet and gold uniform and Kashmîr turban.
Personal beauty is a fairly certain cause of rapid
promotion at the Amîr’s Court. Some of the Court
Pages are the sons of nobles, of officers, or of wealthy
men. Others are slaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slaves in Kabul.</div>

<p>The slaves of Kabul are those who have been kidnapped
from Kaffristan, or who are prisoners of war,
taken when some tribe breaks out in rebellion against
the Amîr. When it is remembered that the Afghans,
though at present the dominant race, form only a part,
and a minor part, of the population, there being
several other nations, of different physical conformity,
different language, religion, and customs, inhabiting
the country, the fact of frequent outbreaks and
rebellions is less inexplicable than it would otherwise
be.</p>

<p>Of the Afghans, to commence with, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
three chief divisions: the Durani or Afghan proper,
of which race is the Amîr; the Ghilzai; and the
Pathan or border Afghan. Each of these is divided
up into many different tribes: the tribes into
branches, and the branches into families.</p>

<p>We gather valuable information concerning
Afghanistan&mdash;Ariana&mdash;and the peoples inhabiting it,
from the ancient writers; but the Afghans, as a distinct
people, do not appear in history until the
commencement of the tenth century; and it was
not until the eighteenth century that they were
established as an independent nation under a king
of their own race.</p>

<p>According to the most recent investigations, the
Afghans, though they assert themselves to be a
Jewish nation descended from Saul, are a conglomerate
race, some tribes, or sections of tribes,
having in their veins strains of Persian, others of
Indian, Greek, or Scythian blood. Of the tribes at
the present day some bear the very names and
occupy the same positions that Herodotus tells us of
as existing in the Persian satrapies of Darius,
and others, the names of Macedonian and Greek
tribes, who were introduced after the conquest of
Alexander. Others again, especially in eastern
Afghanistan, bear the names of Rajput tribes renowned
in Indian history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Afghan King.</div>

<p>In the tenth century was the invasion by Tartar
hordes headed by the Turk Sabaktakin, who established
himself in southern Afghanistan, making
Ghuzni his capital.</p>

<p>He and his son, Mahmûd of Ghuzni, founded a
dynasty in Afghanistan. They were recent converts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
to Islam, and destroying the then dominant religion
of the country, Buddhism, shrouded under the cloak
of Mahomed the strains of different nations that
existed in the country. This wild mixed race, called
collectively Afghan, was at all times turbulent and
difficult to govern, and the tribes fought against
each other without the least scruple. Their present
unsettled condition, therefore, can be somewhat
better understood when we consider that it has
existed, and in a far greater degree, from remote
ages.</p>

<p>It would be tedious merely to enumerate the
multitudinous divisions into which the Afghan nation
is divided, and I have grouped many important
tribes under the comprehensive term Border Afghans.
These, as the name implies, occupy the mountains
on the Indian frontier, and it is they who, by their
raidings, thievings, and turbulence, cause so much
trouble to the Government of India.</p>

<p>From their position, it has been possible for
investigators among the Indian Frontier Officials to
study the customs, laws, and descent of these tribes
more closely than those of the Afghans occupying
the interior of the country.</p>

<p>Of the latter, the Durani and the Ghilzai tribes
are, from their numerical superiority, the more
important. In addition, the Durani tribe has, from
two of its branches, given to the country its Afghan
Kings.</p>

<p>It was in the last century, 1747, that Ahmad
Khan, of the Suddozai division of the Duranis,
created himself Ahmad Shah and founded a dynasty.
It occurred in the following manner. Nadir Shah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
a Turkoman robber chief, invaded Persia, driving
thence the Afghans, who had held the country for
some six or seven years. He placed himself on the
throne, and then proceeded to annex Afghanistan,
seizing first Herat, and after a nearly two years’
siege Kandahar, and finally Kabul.</p>

<p>He ruled with vigour and generosity, and in
such a manner that he completely won the hearts
of the people, and was able to bring to the assistance
of his own troops large contingents of Afghan
cavalry recruited especially among the Duranis and
the Ghilzais. The chiefs of the tribes commanded
the troops raised from their tribesmen. These men
accompanied the Turk Warrior in all his expeditions,
sharing his glory and his success. So much help
did they give him that he openly preferred them to
his own troops, causing, thereby, great jealousy
among the Persian soldiers. Finally, when in 1747,
Nadir was assassinated, the Persians fell upon the
Afghans with such fury that the latter, greatly outnumbered,
sought safety in flight. On their return
to their native country, the nobles of the Durani
and Ghilzai tribes met together to decide upon
the best means of organizing a Government for
Afghanistan. Any union with the Persians was
declared henceforth impossible, and they determined
to elect a chief from among themselves. After
much discussion, Ahmad Khan, the chief of the
Suddozai Duranis, was elected King of the nation,
his only formidable rival, the chief of the Barakzai
Duranis, withdrawing in his favour. Ahmad Khan
was crowned in the Mosque at Kandahar in 1747,
taking the title of Shah. In the midst of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
festivities there arrived a convoy in Kandahar,
bearing from the Punjab and Scinde the tribute
due to Nadir Shah. Ahmad Shah at once seized
the convoy, which was of extreme value, and wisely
consolidated his power by distributing the contents
liberally among the soldiers, officers, and nobles of
his newly-founded kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Downfall of the Empire imminent.</div>

<p>This was the commencement of the Durani
dynasty of Afghan Kings, and Ahmad, by frequent
invasions, extended his Empire from Mashad in
Persia to Lahore in India. He reigned twenty-six
years, and was succeeded by his son, Timûr Shah,
a weak man, who, moving the seat of Government
from Kandahar to Kabul, employed his time, not
in strengthening and consolidating his father’s
Empire, but in gratifying his senses. The result
was what might have been anticipated: Law became
a dead letter; no longer was any road safe from
highway robbery; disorder and anarchy once more
spread over the country, and the downfall of the
Empire was imminent. The Persian provinces were
lost; then followed the Punjab, Scinde, and Beluchistan.</p>

<p>At the death of Timûr, in 1793, matters became
even worse, for his many sons, who were ruling
singly or jointly over different provinces, plotted
and counterplotted against one another in the endeavour
to obtain the throne. Three of the sons
came to the front. Zaman Shah, who held the
throne for a brief period; Shujah-ul-Mulk, his full
brother, who held Kandahar and plotted to obtain
Kabul; and Mahmûd, who ruled in Herat as an
independent Prince, and declared himself Shah of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
Afghanistan. At this time the most powerful and
influential of all the Sirdars was Paînda Khan,
chief of the Barakzai Duranis, and son of the
man who withdrew his pretensions to the Afghan
throne in favour of Ahmad Shah.</p>

<p>Paînda, another “Warwick,” supported Zaman,
and by his power and influence placed him on the
throne. The other brothers were entrapped and
kept in prison on a meagre diet till they acknowledged
his accession to the throne. Zaman Shah,
his court in factions, his brothers plotting against him,
his Treasury empty, India as a looting ground shut
against him by the East India Company, and Persia
threatening on the west, endeavoured, nevertheless,
to rule on the autocratic principle, and though the
Barakzais had hereditary right to the great offices
of the State, he presently degraded and then executed
the chief, Paînda Khan, to whom he owed the
throne, and whose power and intellect would have
been invaluable to him.</p>

<p>At once the sons of Paînda fled and joined the
King’s brother, Mahmûd, at Herat. Him, after
much solicitation, they persuaded to advance against
Zaman Shah. They were joined by the whole of the
Barakzai tribe, who, recognizing Fethi Khan, eldest son
of Paînda as their chief, at once placed themselves
under his orders. After much fighting, and some
treachery, Zaman was deposed, and his eyes put out
by order of his brother. He had reigned four years.</p>

<p>It was in 1800 that Mahmûd became Shah.
His throne was an uneasy one. First, the Ghilzai
tribe rebelled against him, and several encounters
were necessary before they were subdued. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
a most sanguinary religious riot arose in Kabul
between the two sects of Mahomedans&mdash;the Sunnis
and the Shiahs, and the Shah, by supporting the
Shiahs, alienated his own tribes, both the Suddozais
and Barakzais, who are Sunnis. This was the commencement
of his downfall, for while Fethi Khan was
in Bamian subduing a rebellion of Hazaras, the other
chiefs formed a conspiracy and invited Shujah-ul-Mulk,
the Shah’s younger brother, to advance on Kabul,
promising him their support. Shujah at once advanced,
Mahmûd fled to the Bala Hissar fort, and Shujah was
placed on the throne amid the greatest rejoicings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shah Shujah deposed by the Barakzai Chief.</div>

<p>The first act of the new Shah was to seize his
brother, the ex-King, and order his eyes to be put out.
This order, however, he revoked, owing to the influence
of his new Wazîr or Prime Minister&mdash;one of
the chiefs who had invited him to seize the throne.
He imprisoned the ex-King, therefore, in the dungeons
of Bala Hissar.</p>

<p>Fethi Khan returning from Bamian found Shujah
King. He had, however, a vendetta against the new
Shah for the murder of his father, Paînda, by the
Shah’s full brother, Zaman.</p>

<p>Secretly, and with the help of his brother, he
rescued Mahmûd from prison, and again placed him
on the throne in Kabul, himself taking his hereditary
post of Wazîr. Shah Shujah, routed by Fethi Khan,
fled to India, and sought the support of Runjit Singh,
the Sikh Maharajah of Lahore. But Runjit Singh
held certain provinces formerly belonging to Afghanistan,
and he would do nothing for Shujah. He,
however, extorted from him a valuable diamond that
Shujah had guarded through all his adventures. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
diamond had passed from Moghul to Turkoman, from
Turkoman to Afghan, and from Afghan has passed
through the Sikh to England. It is the Koh-i-Nûr.
Shujah, in terror of his life, escaped from the Sikh,
and in 1815 threw himself on the mercy of the East
India Company, who gave him a pension and a
residence in Ludhiana.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Kabul, Mahmûd gave way to every
kind of sensual excess. He was a puppet in the hands
of his powerful minister, Fethi Khan, under whose rule
the country recovered some of its former prosperity.</p>

<p>Mahmûd’s son and heir, Kamran, jealous of the
power and increasing influence of Fethi Khan,
succeeded in entrapping the minister, and, with most
atrocious tortures, he murdered him. The death of
this master spirit, warrior, and statesman was an irreparable
loss to Afghanistan, and anarchy once more
spread over the country.</p>

<p>Mahmûd and Kamran fled to Herat, and the rest
of the country was divided among the brothers of the
murdered Wazîr&mdash;Kabul, Jelalabad, and Ghuzni falling
to the share of Dôst Mahomed, the favourite brother
of Fethi Khan, and the most resolute and gifted.</p>

<p>The government of the country, therefore, with
the exception of Herat, which was still held by
Mahmûd Khan, fell from the power of the Durani
Shah to that of the Durani Wazîr.</p>

<p>Dôst Mahomed took the title of Amîr of Kabul,
or Military Commander, and to him British envoys
were sent on missions of commerce and discovery.</p>

<p>At this time Russia was urging on Persia to take
Herat, but as Herat commands Kandahar, and thus is,
as it were, the gate of India, the British were com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>pelled
to make a counter-move. Then came the first
Afghan war&mdash;the disastrous endeavour on our part
to revive the extinct Suddozai Durani dynasty. Dôst
Mahomed was taken prisoner to Calcutta; Shah Shujah
was put on the throne at Kabul; and Mahmûd, with
his son Kamran, as successor, acknowledged as
Governor of Herat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rule of Dôst Mahomed: a Standing Army.</div>

<p>The failure of the plan is a modern story. Shah
Shujah was murdered by the Afghans in 1842, and
Dôst Mahomed was released and allowed to find his
way back to Kabul, where he was welcomed to the
throne with acclamations.</p>

<p>The rule of Dôst Mahomed, compared with what
had gone before, was a boon to Afghanistan; merchants
and caravans could travel with some amount
of safety through his dominions. Trade recovered
considerably, and with its growth the revenues of the
Amîr increased. For a long time he made no attempt
to extend his dominions, but contented himself in
rendering secure and prosperous those provinces he
already possessed. His brothers lacked the power,
though not the wish, to compass his overthrow, for
though they were bold fighting men, they possessed
neither the capacity nor the resolution of the Amîr.
The danger to the sovereigns of Afghanistan had,
hitherto, been the difficulty in retaining the allegiance
of the great Chiefs&mdash;the Barons&mdash;those men who
could call into the field the thousands of their clansmen
to fight for or against the King. Dôst Mahomed,
though not lacking in generosity towards them, nevertheless
showed them that it would be both difficult
and dangerous to attempt to throw off their allegiance.
As a check to their power in the field he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
established, for the first time in Afghanistan, a
standing army. The Chiefs submitted, though at
first unwillingly, to the rule of the Amîr, for
doubtless it seemed better to yield to a monarch both
just and generous than to attempt revolts, the issue
of which was in any case doubtful, and might place
them under the insecure and cruel despotism of the
Suddozais. Of the extension of his dominions to
Kandahar, Herat, and Turkestan I will speak later.</p>

<p>Dôst Mahomed appointed a younger and favourite
son, Shere Ali, to succeed him, the only one of his sons
whose mother was of Royal blood. In 1868 Amîr
Shere Ali was deposed by his elder brothers, Afzal
Khan and Azim Khan.</p>

<p>Amîr Afzal Khan, eldest son of Dôst Mahomed,
reigned but five months and died. He left one son
only, the present Amîr, Abdurrahman.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his brother, Azim Khan, who,
however, was not recognized as Amîr by the British,
and in the following year Shere Ali again obtained
the throne. His estrangement with the British, their
advance, and the Amîr’s death in Mazar, I have
spoken of. Yakûb, who was Amîr when Cavagnari
was assassinated, was son of Shere Ali. When Yakûb
was deposed Abdurrahman Khan was invited by the
British to ascend the throne.</p>

<p>Considering the line of men through whom he is
descended, it is not so surprising a thing that Amîr
Abdurrahman has shown talent as a ruler, politician,
and general of so high an order. Dôst Mahomed and
his brother, Fethi Khan, their father and grandfather,
Paînda and Jummal Khan, were the type of men who
change the course of history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>I have given this very curtailed sketch of what
has been happening in Afghanistan during the last
hundred and fifty years, so that one may see <em>who</em>
Amîr Abdurrahman is and why he is Amîr.</p>

<p>We may now go back to our former subject, the
peoples inhabiting Afghanistan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of the Ghilzais.</div>

<p>The Ghilzai Afghans are of doubtful origin: they
are sometimes reckoned as Pathan. Their language
is Pukhtu, and their manners, customs, and religion
the same as those of the Duranis; but they are said
to have come into the country with the Turkoman
Sabaktakin in the tenth century, and to be the
representatives of a Turk tribe from beyond the
Jaxartes, called Khilichi, “swordsmen.” More recent
investigation seems to point, however, to their being
of Rajput (Scythian) descent; for the clans into
which the tribe is divided have mostly Indian names.</p>

<p>The Ghilzai is a very numerous and powerful tribe
occupying that part of the country which lies between
the provinces of Kandahar and Kabul. They are a
race of fighting men, but have not given a ruler to
Afghanistan. One reason for their submission to the
government of the Duranis at Kabul, is the fact that
a large portion of the tribe is nomadic in its habits,
moving from highlands to lowlands with the seasons.
They spend the summer among their villages on the
uplands of the Sufféd Kôh, Tobah, and Khôjah
Amràn Mountains, and in the winter packing their
belongings on camels, asses, and bullocks, and driving
their flocks before them, they descend and camp on
the warm plains. Without their winter quarters on
the plains they could not exist, neither themselves
nor their flocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the numerous tribes of Pathans or Border
Afghans I will speak only of the two to which I have
already referred in the course of my narrative: the
Afridis, who occupy the mountains around Peshawur
and the east of the Khyber; and the Shinwaris, who
occupy the western extremity of the Khyber. The
Afridis, who number about thirty thousand families,
say they were transplanted by Mahmûd of Ghuzni
from the Ghor country, which lies between Kabul and
Herat, to their present hills as military colonists for
the defence of the Khyber Pass. Two centuries later
the colony was increased by fresh arrivals planted by
Shahabuddin Ghori. They are probably of Turkish
descent. The Afridis are partly cave dwellers, but live
also in movable huts of matting and wickerwork&mdash;a
rough imitation of the Turkoman <i>Khirgar</i>. They
have few villages and no tents. They are described by
Dr. Bellew (a keen observer, who spent many years on
the frontier in the study of the Pathan) as a warlike
and predatory people, “of lean wiry build, with keen
eyes and hungry features, and of light complexion,
but not of fine physique.”</p>

<p>Other of the Pathan tribes near them differ in
physical conformity, for they are tall and manly, being
often as fair and as strongly built as Englishmen.</p>

<p>The Shinwaris, whom I mentioned in the early
part of my narrative as being considered dangerous
even by the Amîr’s troops, are by some supposed to
be of Albanian descent, and to have been placed by
Nadir Shah in their present position as a guard to
the Khyber. They, however, do not show a trace of
such an origin, for their manners and customs are
Pathan and their language Pukhtu. Bellew considers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
them as probably the Sanobari or Sinawàri Indians
of Rajput descent. Their “peaceful” occupation is
that of muleteers, and they breed herds of mules for
the carrying trade.</p>

<p>One interesting point in the descent of the Amîr’s
tribe, the Barakzai Duranis, is called attention to by
Bellew. He considers that they are probably an
offshoot of the Baraki mentioned by the Emperor
Babar as one of the principal tribes of Kabul in the
early part of the sixteenth century. These Barakis
are considered a distinct race by themselves, and are
not claimed by Afghan or Pathan, Ghilzai or Hazara.
They use among themselves a dialect which appears
to resemble a Hindi language. Bellew identifies the
Baraki tribe of Kabul with the Bàrkai of Herodotus,
who were recognized as Greeks by Alexander and his
followers. They were a colony of Greek exiles transported
from Kyrènè in Lybia, to the Logar Valley of
Kabul, by Darius Hystaspes. This valley is to-day
their principal settlement. The Baraki have for ages
retained the reputation of being excellent and reliable
soldiers, and the Royal Barakzai Durani family have
always entertained a body-guard composed of Baraki.
The separation of Baraki and Barakzai, with the
diminution in number of the one and the increase
of the other, is explained by the probable
suggestion that the former reluctantly, and the latter
readily, accepted the religion of Islam in the early
period of its introduction.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hazaras.</div>

<p>Another nation, and in point of numbers the most
important, occupying Afghanistan, is the Hazara.
They are mostly of the Tartar type, and occupy the
mountains of the west and north-west of Afghanistan.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
They, like the Afghan, are a mixed race. Though
chiefly Turk they have tribes among them of Rajput,
Kopt, Abyssinian, and Persian descent. The Hazara
proper, who inhabit the Ghor country, claim to be
descendants of military colonists planted in this
country by Ghengis Khan, the Turkestan chief, in 1200.
Probably, however, the influx was slow, extending
over several generations, and was more the migration
of a nation than a purely military conquest. The
language of the Hazaras is an old dialect of Persian
with some admixture of Turki words. At the Kabul
Hospital when a Hazara came for treatment I found his
language so difficult to understand, that in the absence
of my Armenian interpreter, I often had to call upon
some one to translate for me into modern Persian. With
their high cheek-bones, small oblique eyes, and scanty
beards, they differ much in physiognomy from the
Afghan, and their form of government, manners, and
morals are equally divergent.</p>

<p>The government of their chiefs is more despotic
and less republican than that of the Afghan chiefs.
Though some tribes are said to be nomadic, predatory,
and the poorest and most barbarous of all the races in
Afghanistan, those I came in contact with seemed,
compared with the Afghans, a hard working peaceful
people, unless they were roused by cruelty and oppression;
then, indeed, they fought with dogged persistence.
They seemed to have a certain simplicity of character
which contrasted strongly with the duplicity of the
Afghan. Though undersized, they are of great
physical strength, and as slaves taken in war, or
servants for hire, they seemed to me to do all the hard
work in Kabul. In religion they are mostly Shiah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Mahomedans, and therefore to the Sunni Afghans they
seem almost as much infidels as the Christians. They
make their own powder and rifles, are excellent shots,
and, in spite of the mountainous country in which
they dwell, are excellent horsemen. As a nation they
have an intense love of liberty, and have been more or
less independent for generations. The last monarch who
subjugated them was Timûr Shah or Tamerlane. They
have, however, paid tribute to the present Amîr,
though many a battle was fought before they yielded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cause of Hazara Rebellions.</div>

<p>To this day the Hazaras are constantly breaking
out in rebellion, but from stories I heard in Kabul I
gather they would willingly pay tribute to the Amîr
as King, but for the outrages and atrocious cruelties
practised upon them by His Highness’s troops.</p>

<p>In their day these Hazaras formed a very powerful
sovereignty, which extended from the Euphrates to the
Ganges. They it was who supplanted the Turk at
Ghuzni, and who overthrew the Rajput dynasty, conquered
India, and established the Mahomedan religion
in that country.</p>

<p>Further north, on the banks of the Oxus river,
the border line that divides Afghan from Russian
Turkestan, are Turkoman and Usbàk tribes. The
Turkoman is, as the name implies, of Turk descent.
This people lived to the south of the Thian Shan or
Celestial mountains, and in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries overran Bokhara, Armenia, and Georgia.
Physically they are immensely strong men, taller
than the Hazara, of rough manners and coarse fibre,
seeming more or less insensible to pain or sorrow:
their cold insensible nature contrasting strongly with
the more amorous nature of Afghan and Persian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>I had a practical illustration of their rough
manners one day in Mazar. I was riding back from
the Hospital, and at some little distance from the city
I met a troop of Turkoman cavalry. I was interested
and rode quietly on, never dreaming of getting out of
their way, for I naturally thought they would do as
others had done, make way for a Distinguished
Foreigner. Not in the least. They just did not ride
over me, but in a moment I was in the midst of the
troop, and as they rode carelessly and rapidly by, one
man brushed against me, ripped my boot, tore the
buttons off the leg of my breeches, and nearly twisted
me out of the saddle. Consider the iniquity of the
act! The Amîr’s own Physician and a common Turkoman!
I was indignant; but decided to ride on and
take no notice; they are men of such exceedingly
coarse fibre.</p>

<p>These people are nomads, living in tents, or, when
they camp for a longer period, in temporary huts, or
oftener in a sort of wickerwork wigwam, dome-shaped,
and covered with felt called the “khirgar.” These
wigwams can be taken down and packed on a camel
in less than an hour. The Turkoman women are unveiled,
and work in camp and field, and weave the
beautiful rugs that are so much in demand in Afghanistan
and India.</p>

<p>The Usbàks are a confederation of many Turk and
Tartar tribes, not one race. They are flat faced,
with scanty beard and slanting eyes. They speak the
same language as the Turkoman&mdash;Turki&mdash;and have the
same disposition, tastes, and ferocity. They do not,
however, lead a wandering life, but dwell in villages,
and may be considered the established and civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
inhabitants of Central Asia beyond the Oxus. Their
type is occasionally somewhat altered by intermarriage
with the Persians.</p>

<p>There are other prominent but less numerous races
in Afghanistan: for instance, the Kizilbashes, who are
the better educated among the townspeople. There is
a colony of them in Kabul, at Chendawal, to this day.
They are Persianized Turks, who were brought to
Afghanistan by Nadir Shah in 1737. They speak
pure Persian, and constitute chiefly the merchants,
physicians, traders, and scribes. His Highness’s chief
secretary, the Dabier-ul-Mulk, was a Kizilbachi.
These men belong to the Shiah sect of Mahomedans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Christian Church.</div>

<p>At one time there was a colony of Armenians in
Kabul, brought from Persia by Nadir Shah, and a
Christian church was in existence, until it was accidentally
blown to pieces in the last Afghan war.</p>

<p>The Armenians, however, have drifted away to
the large towns in India and Persia, and only one
family remains, that of my Interpreter.</p>

<p>I went one day to pay my respects to a Christian
lady in Kabul, an aged Armenian some ninety years
old. She wept bitterly as she told me of the church
built by a Mahomedan King for their use and
destroyed by Christians.</p>

<p>Of other races in Kabul, there are Tajiks of Arab
descent, Hindkis of Hindu descent, and Kohestani
and Pashai tribes, who are considered to be the
unconverted aborigines of the Kabul province.</p>

<p>I was speaking of the slaves of Kabul when the
subject of the peoples inhabiting the country presented
itself. Just now the majority of slaves in
Afghanistan are Hazaras, probably because they
have lately been fighting against the Amîr.</p>

<p>There are also children and women taken
prisoners from other rebellious tribes, and Kaffir
slaves kidnapped as children from Kaffristan. A
batch of the former were brought to Mazar while I
was there. His Highness took about a dozen. They
were good-looking boys of the Persian type, and I
was told they came from the direction of Maimana,
to the north-west of Afghanistan towards Panjdeh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
No one understood their language. It was not
ordinary Pushtu, nor Turki, nor Persian. They,
however, picked up Persian very quickly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slaves in High Positions.</div>

<p>The slave boys at the Palace are placed under the
care of one official whose duty it is to look after their
comfort and train them in their several duties. They
are really Court Pages, and their work is shared by
the sons of nobles and gentlemen. A slave boy, if
he has beauty, ability, and fidelity&mdash;a rare combination,
perhaps&mdash;can rise to the highest positions under
the Government.</p>

<p>One whom I knew, holding a very high position
in the Afghan army, was sold by the Amîr when
he was in exile in Russia. The man ran away from
his master, and found his way back to the Amîr;
again he was sold and again escaped. He returned
to Afghanistan with the Amîr and was raised to high
estate. He was a kindly man, but, in spite of his dog-like
fidelity to the Amîr, was not of strong character.
I do not know of what nationality he was: I was told
that he was not an Afghan, but came from the
north-east. His son was distinctly of the Tartar
type, though he himself had more the regular
features of the Persian. I saw in the newspapers
a short time ago that he was dead.</p>

<p>Two others I knew, slaves, holding high positions
in the Amîr’s service, who were with him in Russian
Turkestan. His Highness will forgive much in these
men, and punish but lightly shortcomings on their
part.</p>

<p>As regards the treatment of the slaves in Kabul,
it is simply a question of property: a man has the
power to sell, kill, or do as he pleases with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
slave; but, speaking generally, the slaves are well-treated,
especially among the upper classes. Sometimes
it is impossible to tell from their appearance
which is a man’s slave-boy and which is his
son.</p>

<p>In Mazar, two boys used often to come and see
me: they were dressed very much alike, in gold
embroidered tunics, and each had a little revolver.
I heard one of them was a slave, but for a long
time I thought the slave was the son. He was an
amusing little fellow, quick at repartee; but he
lacked the dignity of the other&mdash;the almost mournful
quality of which made me think he was the
slave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hazara Slaves a Glut in the Market.</div>

<p>The price of slaves varies according to their
quality: ordinarily it is thirty rupees the span: by
span I mean the distance from the outer side of one
hand to the outer side of the other when, with the
fingers closed, the thumbs are extended to their
utmost, the tips touching. This is roughly about a
foot, so that a baby that length would cost thirty
rupees. However, in Kabul, a short time ago, a
Hazara baby was bought for half-a-crown; the purchaser
got the mother for fifteen shillings, and a little
boy of six for five shillings. This woman, with her
children, were the family of a Hazara of wealth and
position. Unfortunately the tribe rebelled; the men
were mostly killed, and the women and children became
a glut in the market. Some time after the
purchase I was asked to examine the small boy of
six medically. He had been ill about ten days, and
a Hakim had been called to attend him. The case
had been diagnosed as typhoid fever&mdash;and the opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
given that the child was improving. I found the child
had meningitis, or inflammation of the membranes of
the brain. He died the same night: a sheer loss of
five shillings to the owner.</p>

<p>I saw the mother during my visit, she was a good-looking
woman for a Hazara. She did not make
much disturbance at the death of the child, at any
rate while I was in the house. She seemed more
stunned than anything else.</p>

<p>Recently in Kabul it was a very common sight
to see a gang of Hazara women, with their unveiled
faces and their dingy blue dresses, ragged and
dirty, conducted through the town by a small
guard of soldiers with bayonets fixed. As the war
progressed they became so plentiful that His
Highness would often reward a faithful servant or
officer by presenting him with one or more as an
addition to his Harem.</p>

<p>I had been in Turkestan some three months when
I was sent for one morning to see a young man, the
brother of one of the few remaining powerful
Afghan chiefs. Most of the others have been
“expunged.” As a rule I did not visit the sick at
their homes unless I received an order from His
Highness to do so, or unless some one I knew
personally sent for me to visit him. This young
man, however, was a friend of the Armenian’s.
His brother’s territory lay not very far from
the British frontier, and he himself was a hostage
with the Amîr for the good behaviour of his
brother, the Chief. I found he had malarial fever
very severely. When I returned home my neighbour
opposite, the Mirza Abdur Rashid, sent for me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
see him. He also was down with the fever. I prescribed
for them both.</p>

<p>The next morning I felt rather ill myself, but
started about eight to see the Chief’s brother again.
The sun seemed frightfully scorching that morning,
it was August, and presently the headache I had
grew so intense that each step was agony.</p>

<p>I gave in at last, and turned my horse home
again. I went into the inner room and sat on the
charpoy. The Armenian shut all the doors and
windows to keep out the heat, and propped me
against the wall with pillows. Then the backache
began. Oh, my bones! I was one great ache. The
Armenian had seen the treatment I put others
under, and he weighed out the medicines and brought
them to me. I was too stupid with fever and aches
to care what I took.</p>

<p>Just then the British Agent’s Secretary, Amin
Ullah, was announced. He was an interesting man,
but I was compelled to greet him with lugubrious
groans. He brought me five home letters, which
my aching eyeballs would not allow me to read.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Postal Arrangements for the British Agent.</div>

<p>I used to send my letters through the Agent’s
post in those days. He had a separate compartment
in the Amîr’s post-bag which, by arrangement
between the Government and His Highness, was
locked and sealed. Once or twice the letters did not
reach their destination, and it was said that some of
the wild hillmen had pounced on the postman and
carried off his bag. They might do the same to anyone
carrying a bag, but it was never found out who
were the robbers. Afterwards, I did not send my
letters through the Agent’s post, but sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
direct to the Amîr’s post-office. His Highness allowed
me to send and receive three letters monthly, free
of postage. This was not so small a matter as
it seems, seeing that in Turkestan the postage of
each letter came to rather more than its weight in
silver. All I had to do, therefore, was to stick on an
Indian stamp. I found my letters arrived about as
safely through the Amîr’s post as through the Agent’s,
at any rate for some years. Afterwards, when we
came to Kabul, I found there an Interpreter, a
Hindustani, who was in favour with the Prince.
He tried hard to get on as Interpreter for me;
thinking, probably, that baksheesh from the
patients could be worked; as I would not have
him, he proceeded to intrigue against me. I did
not take much notice of the man, knowing that
he could not do much harm. However, he succeeded
in getting hold of some of my home letters, which
was sufficiently annoying, and once he placed me
and the other Englishmen in Kabul in a position of
no little danger: how this occurred I will relate
presently.</p>

<p>I got well of the fever in about a fortnight, and
then I heard that both the Chief’s brother and the
Mirza Abdur Rashid were still ill. I had thought
that, of course, the medicine I had prescribed had
been given them every day. No, everything was at
a standstill, both with them and at the Hospital, just
as I had left it a fortnight before; this is so truly
Oriental.</p>

<p>I, of course, visited them, and they rapidly got
well under quinine.</p>

<p>At this time His Highness requested me to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
one of the page boys, the son of a former Commander-in-Chief
at Herat, who was sick. He was a smart
lad of about fifteen; in appearance very like an
English boy. His house was just opposite a low
tower where the chief bugler took his stand morning
and evening to sound the royal salute. As I visited
the boy when my day’s work was done, I was generally
in his house when the evening salute was sounded.
The bugler was a stout red-bearded man with blue
eyes: he looked just like an Irishman. But however
much these men may look like English and Irish,
closer acquaintance shows how strongly contrasted
the Oriental is with the Occidental. The boy
recovered in due time, but there is a story about
him, an incident that occurred a year or two later,
while I was in the country, which may be
interesting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Page Boy and the Sirdar.</div>

<p>The boy was not a bad sort of boy&mdash;he looked
English&mdash;and we were very good friends, so that I
quite enjoyed my visits to his house&mdash;but he was an
Afghan. One day the Sirdar Gholam Hussain, the
dignified man who has charge of His Highness’s
food, directed the boy to perform some slight
task, I forget what, and the boy bluntly refused.
The Sirdar spoke sharply to him, but the boy
apparently resented being spoken to, for he at
once drew his revolver and shot at the Sirdar; he
missed, and whipping out his sword he rushed on him.
The Sirdar warded off the blow and threw the boy
down. He was brought before the Amîr. In consequence
of his former behaviour&mdash;he had been rather
a favourite with the Amîr&mdash;and on account of the
services his father, who was dead, had rendered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Amîr&mdash;his punishment was remitted to the extent of
a severe caning, and he was discharged from the
Court for a time and sent back to Herat.</p>

<p>Some months later he was recalled. This was not
the end of his adventures, for soon after his return
he objected to the smallness of the pay he received
as page. The Amîr increased it somewhat. The lad,
apparently presuming upon the Amîr’s remarkable
forbearance, again expressed discontent. His Highness
is not a man to be played with. He was
exceedingly angry, and the punishment was proportionately
severe. The boy was degraded and
sent to jail in Kabul. This is a horrible place, and
they who enter it are often never seen again. However,
when we returned to Kabul, I met a gang of
prisoners in chains returning to jail after the day’s
work in the arm foundry: the boy was among them;
but he covered his face as I rode by. He was in
prison about two years. I met him one day after
he was released. He looked very haggard and old,
not at all like the boy I had known in Turkestan. I
pulled up to speak to him, but he seemed even then
to wish to escape observation, so that I merely
said, “Jour-asti? Are you well?” and rode on
again.</p>

<p>The Chief’s brother, when he became quite well,
came very often to see me. He was a handsome
fellow, and I made a sketch or two of him in my note-book.
He had a great desire to learn drawing, but
he was never any good at it. I taught him how to
write his name in English, and he learnt a few words
also.</p>

<p>One Sunday morning, September 15th, 1889, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was surprised to hear a considerable uproar: there
was the report of rifles, the playing of military bands,
and there seemed to be an air of bustle and
excitement with everyone. Presently a man came
rushing breathlessly into my house to tell me the
news. It was not an advance of the Russians,
nor even an outbreak of the Hazaras: no, the
Sultana, the favourite wife of the Amîr, had given
birth to a <em>son</em>. Had it been a daughter the matter
would probably have been hushed up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bearer of Good Tidings.</div>

<p>“Why this hurry?” I said to the Armenian.</p>

<p>“This man, Dîn Mahomed, a little he is my friend;
I know a child come into house of Amîr Sahib, but I
know not when: better this, at once we go to Harem
Serai and send in Salaam, and Her Highness made
glad upon you.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” said I, “and the little, your friend,
Dîn Mahomed, he would like baksheesh?”</p>

<p>“Please you kind,” said the Armenian with an
engaging smile.</p>

<p>“How much?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Sir, your wish. One twenty rupees,” he said,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it rather dear at the price?” I said.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir! no. Other gentlemen, and rich man
Supersala and Officer, give twenty or forty gold <i>tilla</i>
and three or four horses.”</p>

<p>“To a servant! For just bringing news!”</p>

<p>“The servant, he is not keep it. He bring to
his master, Amîr Sahib, and Highness make glad upon
that. Some he give to servant, and some he give to
other servant. And Officer and Supersala make glad
that Highness not send it back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, oughtn’t I to give more than twenty
rupees?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. In my o-pinion twenty rupees enough.
You, mussáfir and stranger, and not know custom of
Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>The bearer of news is rewarded with presents
or with blows, according to the quality of the
tidings.</p>

<p>Mounted men were racing off full speed to Kabul
and the other big towns; those who got in first received
the baksheesh.</p>

<p>We rode off to the Harem Serai to offer my congratulations.
I found a large crowd in the garden
outside the Serai. There was an elephant with gay
trappings, which attracted a great deal of attention.
Two brass bands, with crowds round them, were hard
at work, their style reminding one of a parish
school band. Pipers were marching up and down,
gaily playing <em>Scotch</em> tunes on their bagpipes.
Native instruments were giving vent to moans,
shrieks, and thuds.</p>

<p>When we got into the garden I found I attracted
rather more attention than I either expected or desired.
However, seeing the Commander-in-Chief and some
other officers sitting on a bank under the shade of a
tree, I went up and shook hands with them, and with
the assistance of the Armenian we had some conversation:
not about the weather, that is a subject
which is never discussed in Afghanistan. Presently
I saw my small friend Mahomed Omer, son of
Perwana Khan, who was one of the Pages in the
Harem, and I sent in my congratulations by him. By
and bye two of the Amîr’s younger sons, the Princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Hafiz Ullah and Amin Ullah, about ten and six years
old&mdash;who had visited the Sultana that morning&mdash;came
from the Harem. They conveyed the Sultana’s thanks
for congratulations. Her Highness seemed very
pleased that I had called, for she sent me a present
of five hundred rupees by the hand of the little
Princes. It struck me at the time that possibly she
viewed the visit rather as a national than a personal
compliment.</p>

<p>The birth of the youngster may, perhaps, in the
future complicate the matter of succession. Before
his birth the heir presumptive was the Amîr’s eldest
son, Prince Habibullah. The mother of the eldest
Prince, however, is not of the royal tribe, whereas
the Sultana is royal on both her father’s and her
mother’s side. Her father was a Priest and a Seyid, or
descendant of the Prophet, and therefore hereditarily
a beggar: but he was also a Suddozai Durani, and he
asked for and received the daughter of Amîr Dost
Mahomed in marriage.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, that there is a son who is royal
on both sides, Prince Habibullah’s claim is less decided
than it was.</p>

<p>On the day after the Prince’s birthday the
Festival was continued. Bands were playing all day,
and in the evening a display of rockets&mdash;native made&mdash;was
given.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Accident.</div>

<p>One small boy managed to get hold of some
explosive affair&mdash;a bomb I heard&mdash;and was playing
about with it when it exploded. As he was not
killed they brought him to me. The child was
not pleasant to look upon, for the injury was chiefly
in his face. I gave him a few whiffs of chloroform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and cleared away the blood; but it took some little
time to fit in the pieces and sew up the rents. I
had a good deal of trouble, I remember, with the
corner of his mouth and with the brow and left eyelid,
so much was gone. It was a sort of puzzle to fit
things together. The left eyeball had to be removed
entirely, it was destroyed. However, he made an
excellent recovery, with remarkably little disfigurement,
except for the loss of the eye and part of the
eyebrow.</p>

<p>I seemed to be in for operations just then;
and one I had to do whether I wanted to or
not.</p>

<p>It was on a young Moolah or Priest: he had a
goitre&mdash;or enlarged thyroid.</p>

<p>I think I have mentioned that a priest is disqualified
for the priesthood if he has any bodily
blemish, and this enlargement in the throat distressed
the Moolah greatly, for he was jeered at on
account of it. Several times he had asked me to
“cut away” the tumour, but there were reasons
why I refused to employ <em>surgical</em> treatment. He
was improving, though slowly, under <em>medical</em> treatment;
the swelling was distinctly smaller. Removal
of a goitre by the knife is not an operation to be
generally recommended; firstly, because of the
proximity of the gland to the great arteries of the
throat and its very free blood supply; and, secondly,
because, if the gland is removed successfully there
are serious consequences that invariably follow,
namely, the slow development of a most curious
disease called Myxœdema, in which the sufferer has
the appearance of being dropsical, though he is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
so, and in which the speech and intellect are
curiously affected.</p>

<p>I could not explain all this to the Moolah through
the Armenian, and I contented myself by saying
“Né me-kunum, mé-muri.” “I shall not do it, you
would die.”</p>

<p>He bothered me time after time, and at last I
said impatiently to the Armenian&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tell him to go and get an order from His
Highness.”</p>

<p>I thought that would end the matter, never
thinking that he would go. He went, and, moreover,
got the order. I at once wrote to the
Amîr and explained that the operation was not
necessary, and that, if attempted, the man would
probably die. I received His Highness’s answer
very soon after. He said&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Reply.</div>

<p>“Your letter, in which you say &mdash;&mdash; and so
on &mdash;&mdash; has been received by me. The reasons
therein set forth as to the danger of the cutting
need not be an obstacle in the way of its performance.
If the man recover it is good, and if he
die, what does it matter! He himself is willing to
undergo the risk.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, therefore, but to
operate. I told the Moolah he was foolish, and the
operation would probably cost him his life. He
said&mdash;being interpreted&mdash;</p>

<p>“No, sir. I have no fear. You will not let
me die.”</p>

<p>His complete confidence, however, did not inspire
me with the same feeling. There was a wooden
platform in my garden, and we pulled it under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
colonnade, where it was shady, and the Moolah lay
down. I had sent for one of the Hindustanis to give
chloroform, but he did not come: it was the Sabbath,
Friday. My neighbour, the Mirza Abdur Rashid,
said <em>he</em> could give chloroform, he had seen it done.
As I could not operate and attend to the chloroform
as well, I was compelled to let the Mirza try. He
put the man under successfully&mdash;he had seen it done&mdash;though
he knew nothing of the dangers of giving
too much. I made a longitudinal incision in the
middle line of the throat and commenced dissecting
down with a knife and a pair of forceps, the skin
being stretched back by one of the soldiers, who were
gathered in a group round. When I had got rather
deep there was a sudden gush of blood, rapid and
copious. I had divided the first of five arteries that
had to be cut through before the tumour could be removed.
I wanted to tie the artery, but there was
no finding it at the bottom of a deep narrow cut
that filled with blood the moment the sponge was
lifted. At last I managed blindly to catch the artery
with a pair of forceps and tie it: the bleeding ceased.
After this, I dissected down and tied the arteries
before I cut them. Then I removed the tumour in
its capsule. It weighed ten and a-half ounces. I
sent it to the Amîr, who congratulated me on the
success of the operation. The Moolah we left on
the platform under the colonnade, covering him
with a sheepskin postîn, and gave orders to the
soldiers of the guard to take turns in watching by
his side, and to call me if the bleeding broke out or if
he seemed worse. The Moolah, poor fellow, had high
fever the next day, and the third day he died. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
day or two afterwards I said to the Mirza how
sorry I was he had died, but the Mirza laughed and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Dèk ne me-showi. Be not sorrowful, you said
he would die, and he died. It was so written in
the book of Fate.”</p>

<p>At the beginning of October I received an autograph
letter from His Highness, directing me to consult with
the two chief Hakims, Abdul Wahid and Abdur
Rashid, and advise as to the best manner in which
to rear the infant Prince. This is a literal translation
of His Highness’s letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amîr’s Autograph Letter.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the Honourable and Righteous Dr. Gray,</p>

<p>“Be it known to you that my two Physicians,
Mirza Abdul Wahid Khan and Mirza Abul Rashid
Khan, are directed by me to consult you and take
your advice concerning the customs and ways in
which Europeans of to-day rear their children, and
also concerning the proper time for putting on and
removing the bandages, and the time of giving milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and of cradling and sleeping, and all things which
are necessary for the nourishment of a child, which
are written by the doctors and scientific men of
Europe. These physicians are acquainted with the
customs of the Greeks, and I desire that they be
informed concerning the customs of Europeans.”</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Amîr Abdurrahman</span>,<br />
“Finis.” “I have written it.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>The Hakims arrived at half-past seven in the
evening. I have spoken of the courtly old Abdul
Wahid with his Roman face. He was Hakim to Amîr
Shere Ali. Abdul Rashid was the very fat man with
interminable words. He did the talking, because he was
ignorant, and Abdul Wahid sat silent. They were both
exceedingly polished as became Court physicians.</p>

<p>We compared the customs of Orientals and Occidentals
in the rearing of infants. The Hakims were
very surprised to hear that we did not bandage infants
closely from shoulder to ankle, and so prevent them
from moving a limb.</p>

<p>“How then can you ensure that the child’s limbs
grow not crooked? What other method is there for
keeping them straight?”</p>

<p>I said, “Cannot Allah who created each child
finish His work and cause its limbs to grow straight
without our help.”</p>

<p>“Beshak&mdash;undoubtedly, Allah is all-powerful and
all-wise; but our fathers, and our fathers’ fathers,
placed bandages on the children, and they were wise
men. How do you account for the fact that in some
children the legs are bent?”</p>

<p>I forthwith entered into an explanation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
causes of rickets. How that want of pure air, of
sunlight, and free movement of the limbs, of suitable
food, produced a disease of the bones in which the
lime salts were absorbed, leaving only the soft
bendable gristle, and so on&mdash;but it was not any use:
they knew nothing about pathology, or anatomy either.
So we left that and went on to other matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rearing of Afghan Infants.</div>

<p>The Afghan baby&mdash;among the rich&mdash;is wrapped up
as to the head and neck by a stifling head-dress, rather
like that which an Arab wears to protect him from
the sun, and I could not make them understand the
advantage of dispensing with a head covering indoors.</p>

<p>The cradle is a massive wooden concern. It consists
of a hammock or shallow box, suspended at
either end from a longitudinal bar supported on
uprights, so that it will swing from side to side.
When the child is asleep every breath of air is
excluded by thick curtains, which fall from the bar
over the sides of the cradle&mdash;and this in a hot climate.
What could I say? We differed in almost every
detail; there was no common ground to start from.</p>

<p>The Sultana had expressed her desire that the
European doctor should attend the Prince medically.
I saw a cheerful future before me, for I found that the
nurses would diverge, not in the slightest degree, from
the customs of their ancestors. It is possible to move
a mountain&mdash;granted time and a sufficient amount of
blasting material&mdash;but no amount of blasting will
move an Oriental woman out of the rut that ages of
custom has made.</p>

<p>The Sultana did not nurse her child. A nurse
therefore was sought for to rear the little Prince.</p>

<p>Before the Hakims left my house the fat one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
expressed his deep sense of gratitude that I had
granted him my friendship, and he ended a polite
speech by asking me to see a patient of his. I ought
to have remembered the poet’s lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“I know a Hakim fair to see,”</div>
    <div class="verse">(Only he was dark and fat, but that does not matter)&mdash;“Beware!</div>
    <div class="verse">He can both false and friendly be&mdash;Beware!</div>
    <div class="verse">Trust him not he is fooling thee.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>I went to see the patient: he was one of the
Chamberlains, Nasir Courbon Ali. He was exceedingly
ill with malarial fever, and his skin was yellow,
which was bad. I thought there was a chance of
saving his life if vigorous remedies were used.
I returned home and directed the compounder to
prepare a mixture and deliver it himself. I visited
the Nasir three times that day, but he did not seem to
be improving. The next day he was worse. I had
to go on to the Hospital, but when I returned home
I said to the compounder,</p>

<p>“You sent the Nasir’s medicine this morning?”</p>

<p>The compounder had picked up a little English
from the Armenian. He said,</p>

<p>“No, sir, I forget it.”</p>

<p>Forget it! I was exceedingly angry.</p>

<p>“A man’s life is in extreme danger, and you <em>forget</em>!”</p>

<p>Then he explained, or rather the Armenian did.
When he had delivered the medicine he found the
Hakim there: he left the medicine, noticing where it
was placed; he returned once or twice during the day,
but found the bottle just as it had been left. Not a
dose was given that day or afterwards. Why, therefore,
did the fat old fraud ask me to go and see his patient?
I do not know. The Nasir died the next day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Lessons in English.</div>

<p>Towards the end of September the cases of
malarial fever among the soldiers and townspeople
began to decrease in number, and I had more leisure.
I commenced to study Persian, with the occasional
assistance of Munshi Amin Ullah, secretary to the
British Agent. The Armenian was not, at that time,
sufficiently learned to attempt to teach me. He had
very vague ideas as to moods and tenses: and pronouns
and prepositions bothered him considerably.
I tried to teach him English. He knew the letters,
but words, whose sound and meaning he knew well,
baffled him completely when written. I found this was
chiefly due to the fact that when he spelt out a word
he pronounced it exactly as it was spelt. “Enough”
was a complete stumper, because there was no “f” in
it. He considered it ought to have been “enuf,” and
wished to argue the point with me; so that his
English reading did not progress very rapidly. He
spoke fluently in Hindustani and some of the other
Indian languages, in Persian and Pushtu, and was
picking up Turki while we were in Turkestan;
English, too, he was becoming better acquainted with:
all these he learnt by ear, but Hindustani and Persian
he could both read and write.</p>

<p>About this time I found leisure to take up painting
again. Rather fancying myself in Afghan turban and
robes, I painted my portrait from the reflection in a
hand-glass. It happened to turn out a success, and
created quite a little mild excitement. The Armenian
was not the man to let my light shine under a bushel:
he looked upon me as a sort of possession of his.
Anything that I could do and others could not,
reflected, he seemed to think, a great deal of credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
upon him: so that he trumpeted the news abroad.
I had a great many visitors, and every second one
asked me to paint his portrait. The Armenian said:</p>

<p>“Sir, you not do. This man, who is?”</p>

<p>Which sentence, though it sounds odd, is simply
a literal translation of the Persian, “Sahib, shuma
ne kunēd. In mard, ki’st?”</p>

<p>However, I consented to paint my neighbour
the Mirza Abdur Rashid, and he gave me some
sittings. He had good features, and was dark-skinned
for an Afghan, so that when attired in green
velvet and gold he made rather a striking picture.
The matter reached the ears of His Highness the
Amîr, and he sent for the two portraits. They were
taken to the Palace just as they were, though the
Mirza’s turban was unfinished. When the pictures
were brought back I heard that His Highness was
pleased with them. My own portrait I rolled up and
addressed to England, intending to have it posted
home by one of the British Agent’s men, who was
returning to India on leave. In the evening, just as
I had addressed it, His Highness sent for it again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">

<div class="caption">

</div>
</div>

<p>I went to the military Durbar the next day, Tuesday:
His Highness was very gracious. He spoke some time
about the Moolah upon whom I had operated for goitre,
and desired me to instruct the native dressers: then
he spoke about the portraits, praising them highly, and
finally told me that he would himself give me sittings
for a portrait.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards a carpenter arrived to
take instructions for the making of a frame to stretch
the canvas upon. The next day I caught a most
severe cold. It was the end of October, the sky was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
clouded for the first time, and the weather seemed
suddenly to have become autumnal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dietary Difficulties.</div>

<p>Though the canvas was soon ready it was a long
time before I began the Amîr’s portrait. The cold I had
became better, but, after two or three days, instead of
feeling well I felt much worse. I could not rouse myself
to anything, and I had a constant backache. It
struck me suddenly I might have fever. I had; rather
severely. It was quite different in type from the first
attack I had had. Unfortunately, a few days before, I
had discharged my cook for some rascality or other,
I do not remember what, and the only man who could
cook in the European way for me was my syce, or
groom. This was the man who had been in the Burmese
Police, and who cooked dinner for me the day
we went to Takh-ta-Pul. He could roast meat and
make a rice pudding, but that was about the extent of
his capabilities in the cooking line. With the fever on
I did not seem to hanker after the grey, thin, greasy
liquid he denominated “soup,” neither did I seem to
desire the slippery, sloppy, watery dish he called
“custard” pudding. As bread was not to be obtained,
but only the leathery chupatti, which is not appetizing
when you are ill, the fact began to force itself upon
me that I should be obliged to undergo the Hakim’s
treatment of fever&mdash;that of starvation.</p>

<p>However, in a day or two it reached His Highness’s
ears that I was ill. He at once ordered the two chief
Hakims and all the Hindustani Hospital assistants to
wait upon me, and discuss what could be done for my
relief. It was kind and gracious of the Amîr; but it
appeared to me that if I submitted to the treatment of
all or any of them, I should be likely to find myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
in a great deal more danger of dying than there
otherwise seemed any immediate probability of. But
His Highness’s thoughtful kindness was not exhausted.
Hearing that food suitable for a sick European was not
to be easily obtained from the bazaars, he gave orders
to his chief Hindustani cook, a man who had been
imported from one of the hotels in India, to prepare
anything that seemed agreeable to me. The cook came
every day for orders. I had soups, bread, beeftea, jellies,
puddings, and fruit, and, in addition, His Highness
sent me some claret and a bottle of Chartreuse.</p>

<p>I learnt a good deal about malarial fevers from a
patient’s point of view before I was well again, for I
had three consecutive attacks of fever, each differing
from the preceding one in its manifestations.</p>

<p>When I had been ill rather more than a fortnight,
His Highness wrote me a very kind letter enquiring
after my health; this is a translation of it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the Honourable and Respected Dr. Gray,&mdash;</p>

<p>“May Almighty God grant you health and safety.
I write to you for I wish greatly to hear of your
health. My prayer to God is that I may see you
always well and happy.”</p>

<p>
“<span class="smcap">Amîr Abdurrahman</span>,”<br />
“Finis.”   “I have written it.”<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>At different times salaams and messages of condolence
were received from the Commander-in-Chief
and other people. I was gratified to hear that the
soldiers and townspeople were wishing for my speedy
recovery, for, certainly, it is a privilege to feel you
have been of use.</p>

<p>I became better, and went for an hour’s ride, which
I enjoyed immensely, but the next day the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
attack came on violently. During this attack, when I
was becoming better, I had the honour of receiving a
Royal visit from the Amîr&mdash;by deputy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Royal Visit by Deputy.</div>

<p>His Highness sent one of his chief secretaries, Mir
Ahmad Shah, a tall and courteous man. I received
him, of course, in my bedroom, as I was not able to
get up. He brought me many kind messages. His
Highness had signified his intention of visiting me
personally, but explained that he was prevented by
his lameness and the press of State business. He was
greatly pleased with the work I had already done in
his service, and was convinced that I had no other
motive or desire than to serve him faithfully. I
endeavoured to express my gratitude for the honour
His Highness had done me, and for the many kindnesses
he had showed me while I was in his country.</p>

<p>The next day the secretary of the British Agent
arrived bearing the Sirdar’s congratulations to me,
upon being the recipient of such signal marks of His
Highness’s favour.</p>

<p>Some time before I was taken ill I had written to
Dr. Weir, the health officer of Bombay, to whom I
had been introduced when in India, for some vaccine
lymph, and a day or two after my “Royal visit” I
received a letter from him. He said that all our
mutual acquaintances were well, but that he himself
was suffering from a recurrence of the fever he had
caught some years before in Turkestan! This was
cheerful news, seeing that I had had the Turkestan
fever five weeks already. I said to the Armenian,</p>

<p>“I suppose then this will stick to me for the rest
of my days&mdash;even if I get better now, which seems
doubtful”&mdash;for my liver was touched.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Armenian was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>Oh, no: that fever my friend had was quite
another kind: it was caught at such a place&mdash;I forget
where he said&mdash;and was a very bad fever.
Everybody knew that fever, it came on sometimes
years after. But this fever it was no-thing.</p>

<p>“Sir, if you very ill, how you can smoke papyrus&mdash;cigarette?”
and with other specious words did he
beguile me. I got better after some days, and wrapping
up carefully, for I concluded I must have got
a chill the time before, went for a short ride. I was
all right that day, and went out the next day for two
hours, and came home feeling utterly fagged and aching
in every bone. Back came the fever. The temperature
chart, this time, was quite different from either of the
other two.</p>

<p>The snow commenced, but we did not have very
much, not more than we often have in England, but
the winds sweeping across the plains were bitter.
This attack lasted about a month. In the middle of it
I heard that one of His Highness’s Page boys, rather
a favourite one, named Samander, had met with an
accident. While out riding his horse had become
unmanageable, and the boy’s leg had been dashed
against a tree.</p>

<p>The Hindustanis, who had been sent for, came
to me to make their report. There seemed some
doubt whether the leg was broken or not. They
had, however, put on a splint, but when I asked
what kind of splint, I found that it was one that
was quite unsuitable if the leg were broken. There
seemed nothing for it but to get up and dress and
go off and see. Wrapping up well, and taking a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
stick, I hobbled off with the Armenian for the Palace.
The snow was not very deep, not more than six or
seven inches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt upon the Life of the Amîr.</div>

<p>I found Samander living in a Turkoman khirgar,
in the Palace gardens. The khirgar was a circular
dome-shaped wigwam, about fourteen feet across
by fourteen feet high, and was made of a number
of light but strong wooden uprights, which bent
inwards seven feet above the ground, their ends
fitting into a wooden ring above. It was covered
over with thick felt and then with canvas. A
wooden door was fitted on one side&mdash;this is not used
in the summer&mdash;and a carpet hung over the door.</p>

<p>Around the khirgar was a small trench to carry off
melted snow or rain. Inside, the floor was carpeted,
and my patient was lying on a mattress on the
ground. The khirgar was very warm, for in the
centre was a large brazier with glowing charcoal.
Light was to be obtained only by opening the door
or by lighting a lamp. In the summer, when the
felt-covering is dispensed with, light is obtained by
pushing back a flap of canvas.</p>

<p>On the boy’s thigh there was bandaged a
wretched little splint, quite useless if the bone were
broken. I soon had it off, and found that the bone
was broken in the lower third. It took some little
time to have a long splint made and to put it on.
Several Page boys, who were living in other khirgars,
came in, and also the official whose duty it is
to look after the boys. When I was putting on the
splint, I noticed the scar of a bullet in the upper
part of the boy’s thigh. I enquired how he had got
it, and then I heard the story of the attempt upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the life of the Amîr which had taken place the year
before.</p>

<p>His Highness was reviewing the troops on the
plains outside the town of Mazar. The pain of his
Sciatica was troubling him so that he was not on
horseback, but sat in an arm-chair, which was placed
on a large square mound or platform some four or
five feet high, artificially made. His Highness sat
smoking a cigarette, the Commander-in-Chief, Page
boys, and officials were grouped around his chair,
and seated on the ground by his side was Captain
Griesbach, C.I.E., the geologist.</p>

<p>An Herati regiment was passing, and suddenly
one of the men stepped out of the line, threw up his
rifle, and fired point-blank at the Amîr. Just at
that moment His Highness leaned over to speak to
Captain Griesbach, and the bullet whizzed under
his arm, through the chair back, and caught
Samander just below the hip.</p>

<p>The Amîr continued what he was saying without
a pause, and still smoked the cigarette. The
Commander-in-Chief sprang instantly from the
mound and rushed on the man to cut him down.</p>

<p>Then the Amîr shouted “Stop!” But it was too
late, the Commander-in-Chief’s sword flew to pieces
on the man’s head, and the bystanders instantly dispatched
him.</p>

<p>The Amîr, presumably, wished to go into the
matter, for the Herati was a known shot, and to
enquire the motive of his action with a view of
determining if he were alone in the plot. But
whatever may have been suspected I never heard
that anything definite was found out. It was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
however, an evil day for the officers of that
regiment.</p>

<p>Samander receives a larger pay than any of the other
Page boys, and is naturally somewhat of a favourite.</p>

<p>It was two hours before the splint was made and
properly put on, and at the end of it I was quite done
up. I found that the fact of my arrival had been
reported to the Amîr, for His Highness most kindly
ordered the palanquin of one of the Princes to be
brought to the khirgar to convey me back to my
house. I visited Samander once or twice after that
to see that everything was all right, but my temperature
began creeping up in a way that was not at all
satisfactory, so that I had to give up going and simply
trust to reports from the Hindustanis.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Earthquake.</div>

<p>We had an earthquake a few days after this, at
half-past five in the afternoon. The bed shook and
the door and windows rattled, but it was quite a
slight affair compared with the Kabul earthquakes.
I called out to the Armenian, who was in the next
room playing cards, to ask if he felt the shock. He
came in to know if I wanted anything.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you feel the earthquake?” I said.</p>

<p>“The what, sir?”</p>

<p>“The earthquake! Why, man, the house shook.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said he, “I did think a little the earth
shivered, but I not notice.”</p>

<p>On Christmas day my fever departed. Some time
before, I had written to Mr. Pyne to ask him to send
me a cook, if he could find one, and on Christmas day
a cook arrived bringing a box of newspapers, Graphics
and Punches, and a case of briar pipes, which had
reached Kabul from London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>The Graphics and Punches were a constant source
of amusement to myself and my visitors, the older
as well as the younger ones. I was astonished to
find how little idea some of them had as to what a
picture was intended to represent.</p>

<p>For instance, in one of the Christmas numbers&mdash;it
was of the year before, but that didn’t matter&mdash;a
pig was represented standing up on his hind legs to
take a view of the world outside his stye. Little
Mahomed Omer, son of Perwana Khan, could not
make the picture out at all; finally he came to
the conclusion that it represented a horse in his
stable. The Armenian allowed him to remain with
that idea.</p>

<p>The pig is unclean to the Mahomedans, and he
would have been very disgusted if he had thought
that we ate such a nasty creature.</p>

<p>A frequent visitor at this time was a young man
named Shere Ali, who was, I was told, the second son
of the ex-Mir of Bokhara. A friendship commenced
at that time between us which, like that of the Mirza
Abdur Rashid, lasted till I left the country.</p>

<p>Shere Ali was greatly interested in “Misterre
Punch.” I had to go over the jokes and explain
them to the Armenian&mdash;sometimes, in the more subtle
ones, a matter of no little difficulty&mdash;and he translated
them to Shere Ali in Persian. Shere Ali
generally laughed, though I fancy from the little I
had picked up of Persian, that the Armenian made
his own point when he had missed mine. He was
quite capable of both seeing and making a joke, as
I found in after years when I brought him to
London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>With the aid of the pictures I gave the Armenian
vivid descriptions of London and the glories thereof.
One day, somewhat to my surprise, he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, let me see London. If I die then&mdash;don’t
matter!”</p>

<p>The officer who had charge of the Page boys, came
to see me; he was a short thick-set man, and sensible.
He asked me many questions in surgery, and seemed
willing to learn a few simple remedies in case of
emergency. I was very glad to teach him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Generosity of the Amîr.</div>

<p>At this time I was brought very low in the world
as regards tobacco. I had been reduced to smoking in
a pipe broken-up cigar stumps which, in view of this
difficulty, I had carefully saved. Tobacco, except
uncured, and to me unsmokable Persian tobacco, was
not to be obtained in Mazar. I said to the Armenian,
“I shall be cleaned out of tobacco soon&mdash;and then,
Chaos!”</p>

<p>He said, “Sir, I not know Chaos, what is; but
Amîr Sahib has plenty of cheroot and cig-rette.”</p>

<p>“That is very likely,” I said, “but I haven’t.”</p>

<p>“You not care it, I write him, Amîr Sahib, and
he give it you. What a few cigar or cig-rette!
no-thing!”</p>

<p>“No! you must not do that,” I said, “I can’t
cadge of His Highness.”</p>

<p>“Sir, please you kind, you say nothing. <em>I</em> write,
you not write.”</p>

<p>Sure enough he did write. I confess I was rather
ashamed when His Highness sent me ten boxes of
most delicious Turkish cigarettes, four boxes of cigars,
and a silver cigar-case and match-box.</p>

<p>His Highness had forbidden me to go out till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was quite strong, and it was the 4th of January
before I ventured to do so. I went to see Samander
and found his leg was progressing satisfactorily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Winter Durbar.</div>

<p>On the 7th, it was a Tuesday, was a military
Durbar, and after I had seen Samander and had tea
with him, I determined to go on to the Durbar and pay
my respects to His Highness: this was at eleven o’clock
in the morning. It was the first winter Durbar I had
ever been to.</p>

<p>The Armenian accompanied me. He was gorgeous
to look upon, being attired in a white turban, a yellow
leather postîn, and light blue trousers.</p>

<p>We walked from Samander’s khirgar along the paths
of the garden to the Palace. The trees were white
with snow, and great icicles hung from the branches.
The sky was grey, and the water and mud by the
paths frozen hard. Everyone looked nipped up in
the icy wind. In the far distance to the south were
the mountains dimly blue.</p>

<p>In the open space opposite the Palace was a large
crowd of people with petitions to offer or disputes to
settle. Near at hand was the Amîr’s guard with
fixed bayonets. On each side of a large open window,
which reached nearly to the ground, were secretaries
and other Court officials. At the window sat His
Highness.</p>

<p>The Armenian and I skirted the crowd and went
towards the window, the crowd very politely making
way for us.</p>

<p>I waited awhile, until His Highness had finished
speaking, then when he saw me I took off the
Astrakhan busby I had on, went forward and bowed.
His Highness enquired very kindly after my health,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
expressed his pleasure at seeing me, and then directed
me to come into the room where he was sitting.</p>

<p>I was very glad to do so, for in spite of my furs
the bitter wind began to make me shiver.</p>

<p>I made my way through the door of the Pavilion
into the centre hall or passage, turned off to the left,
and raising the curtains over the door entered the
room where His Highness was. Compared with the
outside it was, in spite of the open window, delightfully
warm.</p>

<p>His Highness was seated in an arm-chair facing
the open window: at his left hand was a little table
with a cup of tea on it. He directed a chair to be
placed for me and some more tea to be brought. At
first the pages placed my chair some little distance from
the table, but His Highness ordered them to bring it
near. While I was drinking the tea His Highness continued
giving judgment in the cases brought before him.</p>

<p>Presently a man, apparently a carpenter, was
ushered into the room, bearing in his hand a curiously
shaped pair of wooden sandals with spikes of iron
fixed into them. His Highness examined them, and
then turning to me explained that he had invented
these things himself, that they were to fasten on the
boots to prevent a slip when one was out shooting
among the mountains in the winter.</p>

<p>The Amîr looked very handsome. He was dressed
in a postîn of dark purple velvet, trimmed and lined
with a valuable fur, called in Persian Pari-pásha, I
think a kind of sable. He had gold shoulder knots,
and a belt covered with bosses of gold. In his right
trouser pocket he had a small nickel-plated revolver,
for I saw him take it out when he was searching for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
a seal to give to one of the secretaries. A fur rug
was thrown over his knees, and he wore a beaver
busby ornamented with a diamond star.</p>

<p>It was interesting to note the bearing and appearance
of the different men as they came before him.
Almost everyone, who was not attached to the Court,
turned pale, some went white to the lips, or yellow
if they were dark skinned. I understood so little
Persian then, that I could not follow what was being
said, and thus was unable to judge if there were any
reason for this emotion, beyond the awe that the
presence of majesty inspires.</p>

<p>Presently, with a suddenness that was quite startling,
the Amîr turned to me, and said in Persian:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Men in autumn and winter are blown upon by
<em>cold</em> winds, and at once take <em>hot</em> fever (tâp-i-gurrum).
In your eyes, what is the reason of this?”</p>

<p>It seemed pedantry to talk pathology, and I spoke
in a sort of parable. I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“A gun is loaded with powder and shot, the
trigger is pulled, the cap flashes and the gun
explodes. The men of this country are the guns;
they are loading themselves with a poison rising from
the earth by breathing it constantly, the malarial
poison. A slight shock, the chill of the wind, brings
about the explosion, and fever seizes them.”</p>

<p>His Highness seemed struck by the plausibility of
this explanation, and presently he said,</p>

<p>“Darûst, darûst, it is right!”</p>

<p>He asked me several other questions, but I am
sorry I have forgotten what they were.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dining-room.</div>

<p>The room we sat in looked not unlike an English
drawing-room. The windows, however, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
different. They were wider than English windows
generally are: the larger ones were filled with plain
glass, the smaller with coloured glass; over the lower
part of one large window was a sort of fretwork of
wood, which, as the light was reflected from the snow
outside, was rather a relief to the eye than otherwise.
The door panels and the window jambs were somewhat
elaborately carved: they were neither painted
nor polished. Draped over the doors and by the side
of the windows were silk curtains of different colours.
The floor was covered with Persian and Turkestan rugs.
The walls were white, and the ceiling decorated rather
crudely with colours. The ceiling sloped up on each side
to a beam, supported at each end by a slender wooden
column carved in distinct imitation of a Corinthian
column, but not fluted. Ranged against the wall were
two or three arm-chairs covered with velvet, and some
small tables with writing materials, vases, and lamps
upon them. The table-covers were mostly of velvet
embroidered with gold: one or two were Indian. In
the middle of one wall was what looked like a white
“overmantel,” though there was no fireplace. This
was more Oriental in appearance than the rest of the
room, the keynote of the decoration being
the Saracenic arch.
<img src="images/zillt243.png" class="inline" width="50" height="24" alt="Saracenic arch" />
On the shelves and in
the recesses of this were small ornaments and vases
of various kinds. Below this decorative arrangement,
and in the position usually occupied by the fireplace,
was a table covered with heavily embroidered velvet,
and on it were two lamps and several brass candlesticks
with many branches, each holding a wax candle,
so that the whole looked rather like an altar in a High
church. In the window that had fretwork over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
was arranged a bank of flowers in flower-pots. The
centre of the room was clear, except that exactly in
the middle was a large brass brazier filled with
glowing charcoal.</p>

<p>At the far end of the room, away from the Amîr,
were seated, cross-legged on the ground, the chief
officers of the army, with the exception of the
Commander-in-Chief, who was ill.</p>

<p>At about two o’clock in the afternoon the Durbar
was over, the petitioners and disputants disposed of,
and His Highness arose. We all stood up.</p>

<p>His Highness did not leave the room, but took
another chair in front of a small oblong table with a
white table-cloth which the servants had brought in.
I did not know whether I was to stop or go, and was
debating the point in my mind, when the Armenian,
who was standing behind my chair, leant over and
whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, please you stop, Highness wish it.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/zillt244.png" width="500" height="134" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Breakfast.</div>

<p>His Highness sat at his table, and a small table
with a table-cloth was placed in front of my chair.
The officers sat where they were. In front of them
was spread a large leather cloth, and over it a white
cloth&mdash;I was going to say “table-cloth,” but it was
on the ground. Then lunch, or breakfast, was
brought in. The dishes were protected with curiously
shaped covers, which were perforated in designs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
One or two were placed upon His Highness’s table,
and several more in front of the officers. His
Highness helped himself, and then the dish was
brought to me. A knife, fork, spoon, and plate were
provided for me, though they are not used in the East
except by Europeans.</p>

<p>I was glad of the fork and spoon, for in those
days I had not learned how to eat pilau with my
fingers. I was just in front of His Highness, and
the Armenian told me that the servants&mdash;who really
waited very well, considering&mdash;were reprimanded rather
sharply by His Highness for not bringing me
a clean knife and fork for each dish: they were not
used to such things.</p>

<p>First, I had a sort of pancake, tasting something
like that ancient sweatmeat called a “jumble;” after
that some meat, I didn’t know what it was, cooked in
a curious way; then some pilau. Altogether I thought
it very tasteful. Afterwards, they took away the white
table-cloths and put others in their place, mine was
blue velvet embroidered with gold, and fruit was
brought, mostly grapes, which had been kept from
the summer in cotton wool. His Highness lit a
cigarette, and I, pulling out the silver cigar-case, lit
a cigar. For the officers, the native chillim or
hubble-bubble was brought and handed round to
them one after another. Each drew a volume of
smoke into his lungs and handed back the pipe to
the servant, who, after blowing the smoke out of
the tubes, passed it to the next guest.</p>

<p>Then the officers got up, salaamed, and filed off.
I did not. I said to myself,</p>

<p>“I am a stranger, and it is the Armenian’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
business to direct me: he has not hinted that the time
has arrived to withdraw: meanwhile, I am very comfortable.
If an error is being committed, on his head
be it.”</p>

<p>There was no occasion to disturb myself. Presently,
tea was brought in and I had another cigar.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, His Highness was busily engaged:
secretaries came in, spoke, received their directions
and went. Letters or reports were brought
singly and in bundles. His Highness opened them
and generally answered each one there and then;
writing his answer on the flyleaf of the letter or
on the back of it. Then he placed it in a fresh
envelope, fastened it down, addressed it and threw
it on the ground. These letters were gathered up
by one of the secretaries. Other letters, after he
had read them, he handed over to a secretary to
answer, but these were comparatively few.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Thoughtful Consideration.</div>

<p>In the midst of all this business a youngster,
about ten years old, dressed in tunic, trousers, and
turban, came into the room; as he entered the
silence of the room, he piped out in his young
penetrating treble the usual salutation,</p>

<p>“Salaam aleicoum,” “God be with you.”</p>

<p>The Amîr, who was engaged reading a letter,
answered mechanically,</p>

<p>“W’aleicoum”&mdash;“and with you.”</p>

<p>Then he looked up to see who it was: when
he saw the small Page boy he said something in
Persian, in which I recognized the word “Khunûk”&mdash;“cold.”
The boy disappeared and presently came
back with a postîn on. I was rather struck that
His Highness, in the midst of the great amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
State business he transacts, should notice and give
orders about such a small thing as the possibility of
a little Page boy taking cold.</p>

<p>When the press of work was over, His Highness
turned and addressed some very kind remarks to me.
He said, among other things, that he had examined
and found that I was more intent upon doing my
duty and serving him faithfully than upon anything
else. In future, I was not his servant only
but his friend.</p>

<p>He appointed a time for me to vaccinate the
little Prince Mahomed Omer, and&mdash;which concerned
my comfort considerably&mdash;he, at a suggestion from
the Armenian, ordered the Afghan bath-rooms
attached to my house to be heated any or every
day, whenever I wished. This is rather an extensive
operation, and one to which, considering the
price of wood, my income hardly stretched. Wherefore,
I was duly grateful. I had some more tea,
finished my cigar, and then asked permission to
withdraw. Before I left, His Highness desired me
to visit the Commander-in-Chief, who was ill with
fever. I bowed and retired. We came away at
half-past four, and the Armenian was jubilant at
His Highness’s kindness and condescension. With
Oriental exaggeration he said that no man had been
so favoured as I.</p>

<p>“Highness very kind upon you: very much wish
you,” he said&mdash;meaning “like you,” I suppose.</p>

<p>We visited the Commander-in-Chief, drank the
necessary tea, and then I got home rather fatigued by
the excitement and the exercise out of doors. I
took off my furs and lit a pipe for a quiet evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
but had to go out again to see a Page boy who was
very ill with fever.</p>

<p>I was on the watch that evening and the next
morning to see if I should have any return of fever
myself. As there was none, I had my horse saddled,
and started, after breakfast, on a visit to the Hospital,
where I had not been able to put in an appearance for
several weeks.</p>

<p>I enjoyed being out on horseback again. I was
riding a young horse that the Amîr had given me.
He seemed to enjoy being out also, for presently he
began to toss his head and snort and plunge.</p>

<p>The Armenian said, sagaciously,</p>

<p>“Sir, he very fool horse.”</p>

<p>The plunging was not sufficiently satisfying, and
he commenced rearing and kicking. Unfortunately the
fever, in addition to making my legs shaky, had taken
a large slice off the normal amount of pluck that one
ordinarily possesses, so that in proportion as his
jubilation increased mine diminished.</p>

<p>The road was very lumpy and frozen hard, and it
seemed to me that the “fool horse,” in his lunatic
caperings, must inevitably slip down and break my
leg. There was an evil time to come. We had got
through the Bazaar without any serious mishap when,
just outside, we happened to come alongside of another
man on horseback. This was what my “fool horse”
desired; the very thing he was waiting for&mdash;he
always was a regular bulldog for worrying with his
teeth, and was a ruffian at striking: up he reared
and simply pounced on the other horse. He caught
him by the neck and shook him, and drove him up
against a wall. Both reared upright, and then com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>menced
the screams and the strikings of two incensed
stallions. The other man was even less happy than I,
for my brute was getting the best of it. I wondered
which of us would be killed, and began to think it
would be the other man.</p>

<p>The Armenian shouted,</p>

<p>“Sir, please you hit him with spur.”</p>

<p>I hadn’t a spur to “hit” with, for, knowing the
horse would be “fresh,” I had not put any on. I tore at
his mouth with the curb, and hit him over the head with
my fist. It seemed to astonish him, for he let go the
other horse, and settled on his four feet again. It was
all the other man wanted: he was out of sight round
the corner before you could say “Parallelopipedon.”</p>

<p>We got outside the town and had a large open space
to cross. Some horses in the distance were neighing,
and, of course, mine answered them shrilly and fiercely,
and he tried to be off at a furious gallop to get another
little boxing match. This I was able to put a stop
to, fortunately, for the ground was much broken up
and very slippery. Having nothing better to do,
therefore, he reared and kicked again. We reached
the Hospital at last, and, with shaking knees and a
thankful heart, I dismounted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hospital in the Winter.</div>

<p>There were a great many sick soldiers at the
Hospital, some sixty or seventy. I was not yet strong
enough to attend to them all, and I chose out about
a dozen who were very ill.</p>

<p>Some of them were mere lads, and there they lay
coughing and panting with acute inflammation of the
lungs. It was in times like this that I missed so
frightfully the well-appointed hospitals and the women
nurses of England. The soldier attendants did their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
best, no doubt, but very few showed any sympathy or
gentleness with the sick. In many of the cases it was
necessary for the patient to sit up for me to listen to
the sounds of the chest. In England the nurse slips
her arm under the shoulders and head of the patient
and helps him up. Here a curt “sit up” was all.
One or two could not do it, and I had to lift them.</p>

<p>Coming away I decided that the Armenian should
ride the “fool horse” and I would take his. He
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I can ride him, but I ’fraid we make
late for your lunch. Better this&mdash;you take mine, I take
soldier’s horse. Other horse come afterwards. In my
o-pinion we get home soon this way.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said, “<em>I</em> can’t ride him home; it is
too much.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” he answered, “it is <em>three</em> much! a
little you not strong, and he very fool horse.”</p>

<p>It was a long time before I could make him believe
it was “<em>too</em> much, and not <em>two</em> much.”</p>

<p>That evening, about seven o’clock, a messenger came
from the Palace saying that the Armenian was
wanted at once by Amîr Sahib. I was a little
startled, wondering if anything had gone wrong.
About half-an-hour afterwards the Armenian, accompanied
by a soldier with a lantern, returned, and
said that His Highness wished to see me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sent for to the Palace.</div>

<p>Outside it was dark and freezing, and His Highness
had been kind enough to send by the hand of
the Armenian a postîn for me, lest I should take a
chill again and have a return of fever. For, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Armenian put it, “Highness say Afghan is stone man,
heat is not hurt it, cold is not hurt it; but European
very soft man, likes flower, soon cold is take it.”</p>

<p>The postîn, of crimson velvet lined with a valuable
fur called in Persian, “khuz”&mdash;I think a species of
marten&mdash;was made to fit the noble proportions of
the Amîr. On my lean figure it showed to better
advantage wrapped round as a cloak.</p>

<p>Guided by the soldier with his lantern, we reached
the Palace and waited a minute or two in the anteroom:
presently a Page boy came out and called me
in. I wondered what could be the matter. But it
occurred to me that it could not be anything disagreeable
or His Highness would not have sent
me his own postîn.</p>

<p>I was shown into His Highness’s bedroom&mdash;at
least, so I conjectured, though it bore no resemblance
to our ideas of a bedroom. It was a smaller room
than the one I had been in at the Tuesday’s Durbar,
and on the other side of the centre hall or passage.</p>

<p>At one end of the room was His Highness, seated
on a divan or broad couch which was covered with
furs. In front of him was what looked like a large
ottoman covered with a quilt which was partly
concealed by a cover of Indian embroidery. This
was a “sandali,” and underneath was the charcoal
brazier. On the divan were piled cushions and large
pillows covered with velvet and silk brocades.</p>

<p>His Highness wore a small white turban of Indian
muslin: over his shoulders was thrown a robe of
crimson silk lined with fur and almost covered with
gold embroidery. The room was brilliant with
innumerable wax candles. Two brass candlesticks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
with branches stood on the sandali, and many more
were placed round the room. It was a very striking
scene. Several Page boys were standing at the far
end of the room&mdash;there was no talking or whispering&mdash;and,
at a sign or word from His Highness, one of
them moved silently to do as he was told. Seated on
the ground at the side of the room, about midway
between His Highness and the Page boys, were three
of the Court: one was the Sirdar Usuf Khan, the
Amîr’s uncle; another was the Master of the Horse,
Sirdar Abdullah Khan; and the third, my old friend,
General Nasir Khan.</p>

<p>I bowed to His Highness and he ordered a chair
to be placed for me: then tea was brought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Illness.</div>

<p>His Highness said that he hoped I should suffer no
inconvenience from the night air, and that he had
asked me to visit him as he was suffering from a
severe chill. He had studied many Persian books on
medicine, he told me, and was intending to take
certain medicines. He took the trouble to show me
the medicines and explain their action. I asked
permission to make an examination of his temperature
and condition, and found he had four degrees of fever
(102·4 F.). Granting that the medicines acted as he
supposed, he was adopting a rational line of treatment,
and I told him so, explaining, at the same time, that
I had not studied the action of the remedies he spoke
of. He talked to me for some time and told me,
amongst other things, that he had studied medicine
while he was an exile in Russia. He said that he
never learnt Russian, but that he could talk Persian,
Arabic, Pushtu, and Turki.</p>

<p>By-and-by sweetmeats and fruit were brought in,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
pomegranates and pears, oranges, grapes, and dried
fruit. His Highness offered me a cigarette, or rather
directed one of the Pages to do so, and I smoked
while he spoke to me. At about nine o’clock His
Highness indicated that he felt inclined to sleep, and
I was permitted to retire.</p>

<p>The next morning at eleven o’clock I was sent
for again. It was snowing fast and I had to put a
plain cloak over my finery, leaving it, of course, in
the anteroom when I reached the Palace. I found
His Highness very little better; he was feverish and
still had pain in the shoulders and back. He said he
had had a very restless night, with much fever. The
attendants said he had been delirious, but I doubt if
they knew what they were talking about.</p>

<p>After talking to His Highness for a short time we
all retired to the Durbar room and His Highness got
a little sleep. For us the inevitable tea was brought,
and I smoked cigars and talked to the Armenian.
There were several small Page boys in the Durbar
room; they were seated cross-legged on the ground
round the charcoal brazier and were receiving lessons
in reading and writing. One or two were handsome
boyish boys, and another was very pretty, but in face
more like a little Italian girl than a boy.</p>

<p>At half-past one breakfast&mdash;in my case lunch&mdash;was
brought in. It was practically a repetition of
Tuesday’s, except that His Highness was not there.
After lunch I smoked on till I had finished all the
cigars I had in my pocket, and then one of the
Chamberlain’s, my friend, Shere Ali Khan, brought
me some cigarettes. We had tea again, two sweet
cups, and half a cup without sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>At four o’clock in the afternoon I was called in to
His Highness. He still had some fever, but felt
better. There were several people in the room.
Beside the Pages there were the two chief Hakims,
Abdul Wahid and Abdur Rashid, and other people,
some of whom I knew and some I did not. All were
seated on the ground round the room, and everyone
was very still.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Conversation.</div>

<p>His Highness addressed his conversation to me.
He told me much about the customs of the Russians
that he became acquainted with when he was in
exile; and he asked me many questions about London.
He seemed to know a good deal about it himself. He
described, for the benefit of the listeners, an English
custom in which gentlemen&mdash;Khans&mdash;of wealth, band
themselves together for the purpose of trade, and
that each band is called “a Comp’ny.” He asked much
about the water supply of London, enquiring whether
it were a Government undertaking, or managed by a
Comp’ny of Khans, and he dropped a remark or two
that showed me he had taken the trouble to secure
previous information on the subject.</p>

<p>The conversation drifted to many subjects, and I
remember he proved&mdash;though I do not say entirely
to my satisfaction&mdash;how much better it was to have
five wives than one. So that, although I was at
the Palace purely in a professional capacity, I found
myself being entertained by the Royal patient in
most interesting conversation. At last he said I must
be tired, having spent the whole day at the Palace.
I need scarcely say that the enjoyment of listening to
His Highness, and adding what I could to his stock of
information, quite made up for any ennui I may have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
felt while smoking innumerable cigars and cigarettes
in the Durbar room.</p>

<p>We got home about six in the evening. I had
then to go and see my neighbour, the Mirza Abdur
Rashid, who had sent to my house several times. He
had fever again. I did not call on the Commander-in-Chief
a second time while he was ill, as I found he
preferred trusting himself to the skill of the hereditary
physicians of his country, the Hakims.</p>

<p>The next morning I went to the Palace again.
His Highness said he was better: certainly he had no
fever, but he looked uncommonly ill. He told me
that, feeling very feverish and oppressed in the
evening after I had left, he ordered a vein in his arm
to be opened and a quantity of blood to be withdrawn.
He expressed himself as feeling considerably
relieved by the operation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, at half-past four, when I went
again to see him, His Highness seemed to have
recovered somewhat from the blood-letting, and was
in very good spirits. He related many interesting
details of his life when he was in exile in Samarcànd
and Tashkend. He told me that, after having read
up the ancient Greek system of medicine as set forth
in the Persian books at his command, he practised as
a Physician among the natives of Russian Turkestan:
that in his spare time he worked at the forge to learn
the manufacture of war materials: that he learnt the
details of gunpowder manufacture, and even worked
at the more delicate and artistic handicraft of the
goldsmith. He said that he tried to learn drawing,
knowing that the art can be applied to so many uses,
but that he never was able to succeed. He praised my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
capabilities in that line in the complimentary
language of an Oriental, and asked me to show those
in the room how one began a drawing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Drawing and Painting.</div>

<p>I asked what should I draw? He left that entirely
to me. A paper and pencil being brought, I made a
sketch of a man’s head, and handed it to His Highness.
He looked at it critically, and said that the only
improvement he could suggest was that the eyebrows
should be a little heavier. After I had corrected this
he approved entirely, and a Page boy took the sketch
round to every one in the room.</p>

<p>“Wah, wah!” they said, in admiration.</p>

<p>The King had approved; the Courtiers admired.</p>

<p>His Highness then said that the only thing he
could ever draw was a tree in the winter-time. I asked
him if he would honour us by showing us how a tree
should be drawn. He took the paper and pencil and
drew two trees excellently. I intended to have asked
His Highness to give me the sketch, for it was really
drawn for my benefit, but one of the Courtiers was too
clever for me, and he annexed it. I did not like to ask
then, for I knew the man would get into trouble if I did.</p>

<p>His Highness desired me to commence a portrait
of himself as soon as he was well enough to sit. I
said it would give me very great pleasure to do so.
There was a discussion then, in which the Courtiers
joined, as to the size the painting should be. Some
suggested that it should be an equestrian portrait,
life size; others that it should be of the King sitting:
and many different costumes were suggested, all
more or less gorgeous. I said that I had only enough
canvas for a “head portrait.” His Highness said
that if I would make out a list of anything I wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in the way of canvas, brushes, and paints, he would
order them to be brought from Bombay at once. I
finally suggested that a head portrait should be finished
first, and if His Highness approved of it, a “full
length” could be done afterwards. His Highness had
never sat for a painting, and I think that he scarcely
realized what an undertaking it is to sit for a full
length life-sized portrait. As regards costume, His
Highness said he preferred a plain coat and a fur
busby. Embroidery and bright colours, he said, were
more fit for women and boys than men.</p>

<p>Afterwards he told us many interesting stories
about the Shah of Persia and other people. The
Shah he did not take at all seriously, and, in particular,
he laughed at the custom there is in Persia of putting
a portrait of the Shah on almost everything; even
on utensils that are used for ignominous purposes.
He described the Persians as not at all cleanly
persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Queen’s Portrait on the Indian Rupee.</div>

<p>It is to be noted that the Amîr will allow no representation
of himself on vessels, stamps, or coins, and
when I learnt this, I confess I was surprised that he
wished his portrait painted. However, when the
portrait was eventually finished, it was apparently
looked upon as an effigy or representation of Royalty,
and, as you shall hear presently, was treated with
some ceremony and no little respect. While he was
speaking about the Shah, he happened to take up an
Indian rupee, and was spinning it about on the
sandali in front of him. Suddenly he said, as he
picked it up&mdash;</p>

<p>“How old was Queen Victoria when this portrait
was taken?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>I hesitated a moment: it was a difficult question
to answer. Finally I said,</p>

<p>“It is intended to represent the Queen, but it is
not a portrait of Her Majesty as she is now, nor, I
believe, as she was when she was young.”</p>

<p>His Highness at once said,</p>

<p>“You are right; every feature is incorrect&mdash;eyes,
nose, and mouth; and even the crown on her head is
not the crown she wears.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for me to explain, through the
Armenian, that the impression on the coin was a
heraldic decoration, and was not meant for an exact
portrait of Her Majesty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fruit and sweets were brought, and I
lit a cigar. When I had smoked to the stump, I
stuck my pocket-knife in to hold it by.</p>

<p>His Highness said, “Have you no cigar-holder?”</p>

<p>On hearing I had not, he gave some directions to a
Page boy. The boy disappeared, returning presently
with about a dozen cases. His Highness opened the
cases, examined them, and then, choosing two, gave
them to me.</p>

<p>They were meerschaum and amber cigar-holders,
the case being stamped with the name of a firm in
Bombay. One was in the shape of a hand holding an
oval, and the other was straight with a prancing horse
carved on the top of it. They looked so beautifully pure
in colour that it seemed a pity to defile them with
tobacco smoke. However, aesthetic ideas did not prevail,
and before long I had coloured them both a rich brown.</p>

<p>By-and-bye I began to think it must surely be
getting somewhere near dinner time, when just then
the clock struck&mdash;it was ten p.m. However, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
not yet the hour for the Amîr’s second meal, and he
continued conversing. He told me of the habits and
customs of the Afghan hillmen; of their agility and
hardiness, their great stature and bodily strength: that
with them meat was a luxury to be obtained only by
the few and by them rarely; of the weapons they
manufactured for themselves, their love of fighting,
and their love of robbery. I said,</p>

<p>“They must be good stuff to make soldiers of.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said His Highness, “but they needed taming.”</p>

<p>A little before midnight dinner was brought.
The Amîr has two meals in the day: one about midday
and the other about midnight. Occasionally
the time is varied. He may breakfast at ten a.m.
and dine at nine or ten p.m. He takes a cup of tea
on rising, and, as a rule, some biscuits&mdash;macaroons
and other sweet cakes&mdash;are brought, though he seldom
eats them. At breakfast and dinner he eats as
heartily as one would expect a robust man to do,
but not more so. The <i>pièce de résistance</i> being pilau,
which consists largely of rice, I think that the Amîr
does not eat so much meat in the day as an ordinary
Englishman. He drinks water only, at meals. Tea
he drinks in the early morning and in the afternoon,
and, curiously enough, tea is usually brought half-an-hour
before and sometimes half-an-hour after a meal.
There is no set rule as regards tea drinking. It is
taken at all hours of the day, except with meals.</p>

<p>When dinner was brought, a tray was placed before
His Highness on the sandali. A small table was
brought for me, and the Courtiers sat on the ground.</p>

<p>The Armenian, who had had a little fever the day
before, had been standing behind my chair all this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
time&mdash;rather more than seven hours&mdash;and translating.
He looked fagged to death. His Highness happening
to notice him standing while everyone was sitting,
said, “Sit and eat.”</p>

<p>The Armenian, however, did not dare to take the
Amîr at his word and excite the resentment of the
Courtiers, the Chief Secretaries, and Officers, by
joining them, and, moreover, he felt shame at presuming
to sit eating in the presence of the Amîr,
so that he made some excuse. His Highness, seeing
his embarrassment, ordered dinner to be served for
him in another room.</p>

<p>When dinner was over I asked permission to
retire, and His Highness gave orders for a
guard with lanterns to conduct me to my door. We
got home at half-past one.</p>

<p>The next day, Sunday, I spent in a similar way at
the Palace. I found His Highness better. After
being with him a short time I withdrew to the Durbar
room, where lunch was served for me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The New Kabul.</div>

<p>I was called in again in the afternoon and His
Highness continued his conversation. He spoke
much about European customs, and surprised me
by the extent and accuracy of his knowledge.
The Courtiers sat listening, dumb with admiration
at the “boundless knowledge of the great
King.” He told me of the city of his dreams, the
new Kabul, that he hoped to build in the Charhardeh
Valley, drawing a plan of the city and of its fortifications.
I enquired whether there were materials
for building near at hand; and asked where he would
get his water supply from, and so on, and he entered
into all the details most willingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>He gave me further information about the Afghans
as a nation: though he described more their obvious
characteristics than those that are unknown to
European investigators. He sent for samples of
native drugs and plants, and instructed me in their
alleged action on the human body.</p>

<p>At dinner, soup was brought for my especial
benefit, for the Amîr knew that Europeans took
soup before meat when they dined. The conversation
then turned upon the making of soup, and His
Highness sent for the cooking utensils that were
used by his cook and described the process to me.
I did not know how soup was made, but I knew
how to extract the nourishing properties of meat,
and I described the making of “beef tea,” giving
the reasons for each step in the process.</p>

<p>After dinner&mdash;I forget what led up to it&mdash;I asked
for a piece of paper and a pair of scissors, and having
cut a square the size of the palm of my hand, I said
to His Highness that I could cut a hole in it big
enough to put my head through: would he ask his
Courtiers if they could do the same. One after another
they took the paper, and the Amîr seemed much
amused as they turned it every way, and finally
declared the thing was impossible. It was given
back to me and I made the usual cuts. One down
the middle and others alternately from the middle
cut and from the outer edge&mdash;this fashion.
<img src="images/zillt262.png" class="inline" width="60" height="36" alt="" />
Of course, it would go over my head then.
The Amîr enjoyed immensely the astonishment and
discomfiture of the Courtiers, and laughed heartily as
he mocked and jeered at them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kafir Page, Malek.</div>

<p>All this time the little Page boys had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
standing, and they looked dreadfully tired. One of
them, the Amîr’s favourite, had fever. He was a
slave from Kaffristan, about fourteen, named Malek.
He was fair-skinned and quite like an English boy in
face, though he wore two large emeralds looped in each
ear by a ring of gold.</p>

<p>There was a hard frost that night, and we did not
get home till half-past two.</p>

<p>The next morning, when I arrived at the Palace,
I found His Highness was asleep, so I betook myself
to Samander’s khirgar or wigwam. It was as well I
went, for I found he had fever. I took the opportunity
also of prescribing for the favourite Page,
Malek. He was a nice lad, and I had a chat with
him. He seemed to be quite proud that he was not a
Mahomedan in religion, though he couldn’t quite tell
me what he was. He remembered only a few words
of his native language.</p>

<p>Afterwards he became a very good friend to me.
He had infinite tact, and if I wished to call the attention
of His Highness to any matter without making a
formal report, Malek was always ready to choose the
fitting moment in which to speak to His Highness.</p>

<p>I did not see the Amîr that day, for he was
engaged, busily and alone, answering European correspondence.
I heard, however, that he was much
better.</p>

<p>On the following day, Tuesday, His Highness
held the usual military Durbar. He sat at the window
of the Palace enveloped in furs. When I arrived, he
desired me to examine the throat of a woman who
was there, unveiled, among the petitioners, and
diagnose the disease she was suffering from. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
I had given my report, His Highness invited me
into the Palace and I lunched with him as before.
He asked me why I had ceased, since my recovery
from fever, from sending to his kitchen for lunch
and dinner. He desired me to continue sending, so
long as I remained in the country.</p>

<p>After that the Amîr’s cook waited upon me daily
at my house to receive orders.</p>

<p>A day or two after this, on Sunday, January 19th,
I was called before daybreak to vaccinate the little
Prince, Mahomed Omer. The very fat man, Hakim
Abdur Rashid, came for me while I was dressing;
the servants prepared tea and then we started. The
Prince was not living in the harem with his mother,
the Sultana: he had a house of his own not very
far from mine.</p>

<p>The Hakim waddled by my side, talking and
talking, and panting, and still talking in his unctuous
voice, and I stalked on in the darkness. Dawn was
so near that we brought no lanterns, and before we
reached the house the light of morning was gleaming
on the snow. At the high gate, leading to the
gardens, was a sentry with fixed bayonet.</p>

<p>Just as we reached the gate an old “sakabi,”
or water-carrier, was passed in by the sentry. Before
he was allowed to cross the gardens with his
leather water-bag to fill the house deghchis, or water-pots,
the sentry made him unloose his turban and
droop the end of it over his eyes so that he could
see on the ground only.</p>

<p>“Women about?” I said to the Armenian.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Highness’ sister here and other lady.”</p>

<p>“Shall we see them?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir. Please you not talk. Perhaps this fat
man understand. Highness make angry if he
hear.”</p>

<p>Our eyes were not bandaged, though the Armenian
and I were a good deal younger than the
“sakabi.” The fat Hakim did not count. We
crossed the garden and went up some steps into a
lobby and the Hakim called out:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Kussi ast?” “Anyone here?”</p>

<p>A door on our right opened and the old Hakim,
Abdul Wahid, appeared, and raising a curtain ushered
us into the room.</p>

<p>The usual charcoal brazier stood in the middle
of the carpet, curtains hung by the windows and
over the doors.</p>

<p>The curtain over a doorway, at the far side of the
room, was slightly pulled back, and, though we could
see no one, it was here I heard that the ladies
were concealed.</p>

<p>Seated by the side of the brazier was a fair
young woman with a baby on her knee. These
were the little Prince and his nurse. There
were two older women, also nurses, seated by the
fire. None of the women were veiled, but each had
a cashmere shawl over her head, which she pulled
slightly across the lower part of the face. All rose
as we entered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vaccination of Prince Mahomed Omer.</div>

<p>The Prince was a bright-eyed healthy-looking
little fellow, with a skin slightly darker than that
of an English baby. He was very much swaddled-up
in clothes. Over his head was thrown a square
of white cashmere, which was held back from the
face and kept in position by a band round the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
A chair and a little table were placed for me, and
the inevitable tea was brought.</p>

<p>The Hakim and nurses sat on the ground again.
The Armenian remained standing.</p>

<p>Presently, I said to the Armenian, “I am quite
ready now to vaccinate the Prince.”</p>

<p>It was broad daylight by this time, and I had
my lancet and vaccine lymph with me.</p>

<p>The Armenian spoke to the Hakim Abdul Wahid,
and he directed the nurse to undress the child
sufficiently to expose the upper arm. The nurse
commenced to unfasten the innumerable strings and
bandages in which the Prince was bound up. As
this operation needed both her hands, of course it
was not her fault that the shawl fell back from her
face. She was really a very pretty girl. She had
a little crimson jacket, a long white camise reaching
to the knee, loose oriental trousers, and a little
gold-embroidered cap, like a polo cap, put coquettishly
on one side: the embroidered cashmere
shawl draped from the head over the shoulders.
As she sat with the child on her knee and the
early sun shining on them, it struck me what a
picture they would make for the Madonna and
Child.</p>

<p>The two old ladies were not so smartly dressed.
They had dark-grey shawls and a sort of hood on
the head. They looked like nuns and acted as a
“foil” to the nurse.</p>

<p>When the little Prince’s arms were free, he
waved them about and crowed joyously. As he
lay on the nurse’s lap I was obliged to sit on the
ground to vaccinate him. The operation did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
take many seconds. He looked somewhat astonished
when he felt the first prick of the lancet:
possibly it was the first sensation of pain he had
ever experienced, and he gave a little whimper
before I had quite finished. Then his arm was
bound up and he was dressed again.</p>

<p>When we came away, the portly Abdur Rashid
took a ceremonious and courtly leave, but Abdul
Wahid walked part of the way home with me. He
did not talk. He was dressed in pure Afghan
costume of the plainest kind. A loose brown coat
or robe reaching to the knee, plain blue turban
and a thin brown cloak, or lungi, of camels’ hair
draped in classic folds over his shoulders.</p>

<p>I never saw anyone who could throw the end
of the cloak over the left shoulder so negligently,
and yet have it fall in such folds as he could.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afghan desire for Vaccination.</div>

<p>The old Hakim departed on his way home, and
we met the “Master of the Carpets,” Bai Mahomed
Khan. He apparently had been lying in wait for
us, and he begged me to come to his house and
vaccinate his infant son. As I had plenty of lymph
we went on to his house to do so. We waited in
the porch while he went in to drive all the women
away; consequently, the child had to be undressed
and held by a man-servant. In the afternoon, two
of the little Prince’s Kaffir slave boys were sent to
my house to be vaccinated; and on succeeding days
several more were sent for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Many people, even those not attached to the
Court, came and asked, as a favour, that I would
vaccinate their children. Some cases I was, of
necessity, obliged to postpone until I could get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
further supply of lymph. In Kabul, I saw many
people suffering from the frightful results of that
dread disease, Small-pox, when it seizes upon those
unprotected by vaccination. In England, where vaccination
is so universal, it is rare to see a bad case.</p>

<p>I visited the Prince every day for about a fortnight.
Abdul Wahid generally met me at the house.
He and I were to attend to the Prince’s health and
up-bringing. Abdur Rashid did not appear after the
first visit. I did not vehemently press European
innovations after the first day or two, for the
Armenian said, with useful sagacity:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, suppose you take away bandages and head
coverings, and curtains, and Shahzada Sahib take cold,
blame come upon you. Better you let the women do
in Afghan custom, then no harm come for you.”</p>

<p>I took his advice, and the more willingly, because
none of my suggestions had, hitherto, produced the
slightest effect. For immovable obstinacy there is
nothing to match the conservatism of an Eastern
woman.</p>

<p>I soon became friendly with the little Prince, and
trotted him on my knee, or walked about the room
with him in my arms. I never kissed him, for I
thought it better to consider the religious scruples of
the Sultana. Being a Feringhi there was always a
chance that I <em>might</em> have eaten pig.</p>

<p>One day he was very merry, and was laughing
when I said good-bye and left the room. Immediately
one of the old nurses followed me out and begged a
hair from my head, so that no evil should result
from my having left him while he was laughing.
The hair was burnt with due ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dreadful Old Lady and her Suggestion.</div>

<p>This old lady asked me one day if I were
not very “dek”&mdash;<i>ennuié</i>&mdash;living alone in a strange
land. She said,</p>

<p>“Why do you not buy a little Kaffir girl with
a white skin, and make her your wife?”</p>

<p>I said I was betrothed to an English girl.</p>

<p>“England!” she said, “that is a far journey
from here. Take to yourself a wife in Afghanistan,
and your English wife can remain in England.”</p>

<p>You wicked old lady! I thought. I said,</p>

<p>“It is not the custom of my country, and is forbidden
by our religion.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>I began to get afraid of this old lady.</p>

<p>Another day the younger nurse volunteered a
remark. She asked me&mdash;Were there in England
any women as beautiful as she, with skin as white and
eyes as dark.</p>

<p>The old ladies remarked that her question was exceedingly
ill-bred, and one likely to cause offence to me.</p>

<p>The Armenian told her that she, and such as she,
were not fit to carry the shoes of an English lady.
I said he was quite right: so she was snubbed all
round. However, she did not seem to mind, for she
sat and smiled to herself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was continuing my Persian lessons,
whenever Munshi Amin Ullah, the Agent’s secretary,
could spare an hour to visit me. One day I persuaded
him to read “Bret Harte” aloud to me. It was
delicious to see this highly-educated Mahomedan&mdash;he
was an excellent fellow&mdash;sitting cross-legged on the
ground, solemnly declaiming the “Heathen Chinee.”</p>

<p>As I laughed, I said, “By Jove! it <em>is</em> funny!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>He said he thought it was very difficult and very
incorrect English. I told him that was just where the
joke came in. He smiled politely, and asked why I
said “By Joe!” He had often heard Englishmen
use the expression, and knew that Joe was an
abbreviation of Joseph, though why we should say
“By Joe,” or who Joe was, he had not heard.
I explained the origin of the expression, and described
Jove as the god of the Romans.</p>

<p>I asked him if he had considered the Christian
Religion. He told me he had studied the Jewish
Bible and the Christian Testament. He could not
understand how a race so intellectual as the English
could accept the&mdash;to him&mdash;incomprehensible idea of
three Gods. I said that Christians believed in one
God only, and I endeavoured to illustrate the Trinity
in Unity by describing the trinity that exists in every
man: of will, intellect, and deed. To do anything
one must first have the wish, or will, from that is
begotten the thought how to do it, then comes the
deed. He did not discuss the point.</p>

<p>He said another thing that puzzled and surprised
him considerably was the custom among the English
of selling their wives. I said,</p>

<p>“But Englishmen do not sell their wives.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “and, moreover, it is published in
the newspapers when they do so.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I mean this: an English woman becomes wearied
of her husband, and prefers another to him. The
man who is preferred is called a ‘co-respondent.’
Straightway they go before the Kasi&mdash;the Magistrate,
and, after much discussion, it is decided at what price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the co-respondent shall buy the woman. The money
is then paid to the husband.”</p>

<p>This gave me a sort of shock.</p>

<p>“People of my race,” he continued, calmly, “do
differently. When a woman prefers another to her
husband&mdash;they kill her.”</p>

<p>I asked if he were married. He said “No.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plurality of Wives.</div>

<p>“Do you,” I said, “consider that a plurality of
wives is to be desired?”</p>

<p>“Among people of my race,” he replied, “a
plurality of wives is lawful; but that which is lawful
is not always expedient.”</p>

<p>“In what way is it inexpedient?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Firstly, there is the question of expense.
Secondly, a plurality of wives is a source of constant
annoyance and anxiety. One wife will live in peace
with her husband; but with two or more, there is no
peace: for ever they are quarrelling.”</p>

<p>A day or two after the vaccination of the Prince, His
Highness sent word that he would be prepared to give
me a sitting for his portrait on the following day.</p>

<p>Paint-box, canvas, and easel were therefore taken
to the Palace at once.</p>

<p>The next morning I woke up as usual about six,
opened the windows of the inner room and the top
sash of one of the outer windows, to let in the light
and air. I could hear Hafiz, the compounder, who
was a Priest, reciting aloud his prayers in the servants’
room. It took him, as a rule, an hour and a half to
two hours to say his prayers in the early morning.
During my illness I had had the Armenian sleep on
the floor of my room, and the noise I made in opening
the windows woke him.</p>

<p>“Sir, how do you do?” said he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“I open the windows,” I said. “That is how
I do.”</p>

<p>“Sir, why you not call me? I open windows.”</p>

<p>“Open them, then,” I said.</p>

<p>“Sir!” said he, “my wish is not I get up.”</p>

<p>I went to the door of the servants’ room. Hafiz
stopped his prayers to say, “Sir?” I told him to
bring me some tea. He boiled the water, and brought
me some tea in a very short time, then went on with
his prayers.</p>

<p>I wanted to continue a letter home, but it was too
dark to see till half-past seven. Outside it was snowing
fast: there was a dull and leaden looking sky, and it
was bitterly cold. The weather had been very changeable.
We had had rainy muggy days, hot sunshiny
days, snowy days, and bitterly cold, dull, windy days,
one after another. The result was that people went
about sneezing or coughing. At eight I had my
breakfast, hot bread and milk, and then went off to
the Prince’s house to see that his arm was progressing
satisfactorily. From there I went on to the Palace.
It had ceased snowing, and the clouds had broken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The First Sitting for the Amîr’s Portrait.</div>

<p>His Highness asked, Where should he sit? I found
I had considerable difficulties to face. There was no
platform to raise my sitter level with the eye, nor
any way in which I could get a suitable top light
which would cast some shadow under the eyebrows
and chin. I had to do the best I could with the
ordinary light from a large window. The most
serious obstacle was the reflection <em>upwards</em> from the
snow outside.</p>

<p>His Highness sat exceedingly well, and the
Courtiers and Pages clustered in a group round, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
I made my charcoal sketch of His Highness on the
canvas. It came very well&mdash;I can draw a good deal
better than I can paint&mdash;and the Courtiers said, “Wah!
Wah!” One of the chief secretaries, however, ventured
a criticism on the drawing of the eyebrow. When he
had finished what he had to say, I bowed and offered
him the charcoal to continue the drawing. He seemed
rather taken aback, and said&mdash;No, no, he could not
draw. The Amîr told him not to make a fool of
himself before an Englishman.</p>

<p>I thought the “drawing in” would be enough for
one sitting, and when I had just finished, a Deputation
of citizens from one of the neighbouring towns arrived;
they waited upon His Highness to petition him concerning
a tax that had been imposed. I did not
understand all the details, but His Highness told
them to dig for gold on the banks of the Oxus.
There is alluvial gold there: for I afterwards bought
several hundred pounds worth.</p>

<p>When the Deputation had departed lunch was
brought in, and afterwards, while I was smoking,
His Highness asked me much about the climate of
England, and compared it with that of Australia.
He spoke of the difference in the time of day in
those two countries at any one given moment. He
also discussed the cause of clouds in the sky, and
the Courtiers listened in awed astonishment.</p>

<p>I came away about half-past three in the afternoon,
and Malek, the favourite Kaffir Page boy, came
out with me. I had a rough whitethorn walking-stick
in my hand, that a friend had cut out of a
hedge and saved for me in England. Malek asked
why I carried such a stick, and I explained. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
thought it a poor stick for a gentleman to carry, and
ran in and brought me out one of His Highness’s
walking-sticks. I said to the Armenian:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is this correct?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “Malek can do so.”</p>

<p>I haven’t the stick now, for someone “annexed”
it a few months afterwards.</p>

<p>The next day one of the Hospital assistants got
into trouble. He gave a patient too much strychnine:
however, he was not punished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Comment on the Paragraph.</div>

<p>During a sitting shortly after this, His Highness
told me of a report he had had from his Agent in
Calcutta, concerning a paragraph in a newspaper
there. It stated that I had given an opinion to the
effect that His Highness was suffering from gout
in the stomach, and could not live more than five
years. As a matter of fact, I had given no such
opinion. His Highness told me not to allow my
mind to be distressed, as he considered either the
report or the paragraph to be false.</p>

<p>At another sitting an incident occurred which
might have given rise to a serious mishap. It
occurred in this way: I was working at the watch
chain, but presently His Highness moved and the
chain became disarranged. Without thinking where
I was&mdash;for I was absorbed in the painting&mdash;and
acting as if he were an English gentleman and not
an Oriental Prince whose life had already been
attempted, I walked suddenly up to the Amîr to
re-arrange the chain. There was a dead silence,
though I hardly noticed it at the time, but I saw
that the Amîr looked very hard at me. Then with
a bow I went back to my work. Nothing was said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>When we reached home the Armenian told me that
he and every one else in the Court were exceedingly
startled by my walking suddenly up to His Highness.
He was just as likely to have shot me as not. It was
contrary to etiquette to approach near uninvited;
and the suddenness was so very suggestive of evil
designs. However, His Highness was not seriously
annoyed. He saw at once that I meant no evil, nor
any disrespect.</p>

<p>When I went to the Prince’s one morning, I was
informed that the Sultana wished me to paint her
little son’s portrait. He was not to be painted as a
baby four or five months old, but sitting upright with
a tunic and busby on, like his father, the Amîr. The
tunic and busby were then being made. This seemed
likely to be a difficult task.</p>

<p>I was accompanied back to my house by the
Captain of the Prince’s guard, who had had a very
severe toothache for some days, and he came to have
the tooth out. He was a very large Afghan, much
taller than I, but he was very nervous about the
operation. I sat him in the chair, selected my
forceps, put my arm firmly round his neck and
pushed the forceps well home.</p>

<p>He screamed, slid down in the chair, and kicked
violently. It was no use, however: I had him firmly,
and the tooth too. He thanked me very profusely
when the operation was over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Shooting Expedition and its Dangers.</div>

<p>At the next sitting, His Highness asked if I
were fond of shooting. The Armenian at once
answered, that it was the one particular delight of
my soul. His Highness said he would send a rifle to
my house, so that I might ride out on the plains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
have some antelope shooting. Accordingly, the next
afternoon, when the rifle arrived, the Armenian and
I, accompanied by a servant, started on our expedition.
We rode through the city, my horse going
beautifully, as quiet as a trotting camel, till we
reached the plain. Then, suddenly, he gave a
scream, sprang up in the air, flung out his heels,
and&mdash;&mdash;but he did not have me off. No! I was
not just convalescent from fever then, and he went
quietly again. But I was on the watch, for I knew
his ways. Four times he tried that buck. I am
not a bold rider, I much prefer a quiet horse: but,
it was the best I had.</p>

<p>I thought I would try the rifle, and I dismounted
and put in a cartridge. The gun was a Martini-Henry
pattern, made in Mazar, and I felt myself
rather a dare-devil sort of fellow in venturing to
fire it off. I aimed at a crow and pulled the
trigger: there was a violent explosion. I did not
hit the crow, but the gun kicked very much and
cut my lip and made my eyes water. I determined
that this should not occur again, so, therefore, I
held the rifle very tight, shut my eyes, drew my
head away, and fired. But I did not hit the mark.
I asked the Armenian if he were sure that the gun
was sighted right. He said he did not know.</p>

<p>I said, “You had better try it.”</p>

<p>He said he had a pain in his arm: so we rode
on a little further.</p>

<p>By-and-bye, the Syce (the Burma policeman) summoned
up courage and said he thought he could shoot.</p>

<p>I said, “Very good. There’s a crow over there:
you may shoot it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a long time getting ready, for he felt
it was a dangerous thing to do, and he turned very
white. Then he fired, but he did not hit. Evidently,
the gun was faulty.</p>

<p>Then we thought we would come home. On
the way back, we saw a man on a young horse.
He kept jumping him about the road, first one
side then the other. The Armenian turned on him
in anger and told him he was a woman.</p>

<p>The young man seemed indignantly surprised,
and stoutly affirmed that he was <em>not</em> a woman.</p>

<p>The Armenian rode up to him, caught him by
the coat and shouted, “You <em>are</em> a woman.”</p>

<p>He shouted back, “I am <em>not</em> a woman.”</p>

<p>They looked very fierce, and I thought they
were coming to blows. But the young man snatched
his coat away and went off at a gallop. The Armenian
followed him a little way, then came back
looking satisfied.</p>

<p>My horse went back very quietly, but I felt sure
his feelings were hurt at not being able to run away
when he wanted to. He did not often want to run:
he much preferred walking, as a rule.</p>

<p>That evening, the Armenian went out to dinner to
the Page boy’s, next door, and a creature came in the
evening to sing in the servants’ room. How I loathed
him! He had a frightful voice. I told them to shut
all the windows, but it was no use; I could hear him.
He delighted in prolonging an upper note on the
vowel e-e-e-e. Imagine it! He indulged copiously
in the trill, which he produced by shaking his head.
Then he took a run down the scale, slurring one
note into the other. When I first came to Mazar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
he wanted to sing to me frequently; but I thanked
him and said that, not being fond of music, I would
pay him a trifling sum <em>not</em> to sing to me. Then he
wanted to play to me on the “Rhubarb.” Why
the instrument&mdash;it is a sort of mandolin&mdash;should
have the same name as that particularly nasty vegetable,
I don’t know. It has a harsh and penetrating
sound and I begged to be excused.</p>

<p>Among the natives, however, the “Rubâb” is a
very popular instrument: it is played with the
plectrum, a piece of ivory held between the finger
and thumb. There is another instrument resembling
the Rubâb, which is played with a bow. A third, the
“Seithar,” resembles a banjo with a four-foot arm;
it has three strings and is played with the fingers.
The “Tom-toms” or drums are the same as in India.</p>

<p>Every military camp is provided with a bronze
gong on which the hours are struck day and night,
the time being taken from the noonday gun, which is
regulated by the Amîr’s repeater. In Turkestan I
was for a long time charmed by the sound of the
gongs: it resembled so exactly the distant church
bells of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scenery of Mazar.</div>

<p>As a residential spot Mazar had its drawbacks.
The utter absence of the picturesque; the bare
monotonous plain with scorching poisonous summer
and icy winter; the hopeless colony of those unhappy
outcasts the lepers; these surroundings, in spite of
the novelty of the situation, had of necessity a
depressing effect on the health. There were, however,
certain counteracting elements, for besides the
homelikeness of the distant bells, there was the goodwill
shown by the townsfolk. These were mild and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
inoffensive people who exhibited considerable kindliness
and courtesy. Riding home one day from the
Hospital I perceived a small boy “who put his thumb
unto his nose and spread his fingers out.” In
astonishment I pulled up to look at him. He at once
added his other hand, thumb to finger.</p>

<p>“Behold this youth!” I said to the Armenian
severely, “he reviles the stranger that is within his
father’s gates.”</p>

<p>“No, Sir,” said the Armenian, “he give it you
very great salaam.”</p>

<p>“My son, it behoves not the King’s Interpreter to
deceive with specious words.”</p>

<p>“Sir, truly I speak: this is Mazari salaam.”</p>

<p>I perceived then that the boy’s thumb was at the
root of the nose between the eyebrows, and that the
hands were horizontal. As we rode on I noted
with considerable interest other salutations in the
market-place. The Mazari peasants salaamed as did
the boy. By others, we were greeted by the dignified
bow and the “salaam aleicoum” of the Afghan.
We returned the bow, allowing a polite smile to
irradiate our countenance and answered “W’aleicoum
salaam.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prince Amin Ullah.</div>

<p>Ere reaching our own house we perceived Prince
Amin Ullah, aged three, accompanied by his tutor.
Stopping his palanquin the Prince responded to our
bow by touching, in the military fashion, his astrakhan
hat. After politely enquiring each other’s health&mdash;we
made no reference to the state of the weather, as
is the custom in Occidental cities&mdash;we courteously
took leave of one another, saluting in the same manner
as when we met. The young Prince has the privilege<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of possessing considerable personal beauty, and,
added to that, he is very precocious&mdash;added to that he
shows&mdash;he exhibits, a discernment and wisdom far
beyond his years. Many are the wise sayings
attributed to this Royal Child (I have forgotten what
they were, but they told me he was very clever) so
that he is indeed a true son of his august Papa&mdash;Sire
(I should say).</p>

<p>Then we rode in at the porch of our house, and
dismounting from our wearied but sprightly steed,
we ascended the steps and sought the privacy of
our own apartments. I think that winds it up all
right.</p>

<p>The next day I had an awful cold in my head, so
that after I had seen my patients and had visited the
Prince I stayed in. I made a sketch of the Armenian,
in which he looked precisely like a Salvation Army
captain. I don’t know why, for he certainly had not
that look himself. Then the Armenian went for a
ride. He asked if I wished to go, but I said no. I
did not feel up to encountering the eccentricities of
my steed.</p>

<p>I had taken back into service the cook whom I had
discharged for swindling, and presently he came in.
He brought lunch, and I thought I might as well eat
it as not: it was something to do. I hoped he would
not speak to me, for I knew if he did I should pour all
the fragments of languages I had learnt on his head,
and then he would say, “Bôt achcha, Sahib”&mdash;“very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
good, sir.” Then I should have sprung up and
withered him with a look.</p>

<p>He was wise, and did not speak; but he irritated
me with his nervous servility. One would think that
I was violent&mdash;I am not. I never kicked him, nor
threatened to shoot him, or anything. Moreover, I
even went so far as to tell the Armenian to explain to
him, for he could not speak English, that I should <em>not</em>
tear him into small pieces and grind his bones to
powder, unless he tried to cheat me again. He pretended
to smile, but I do not think he believed me.</p>

<p>The roast fowl was tough: but, no, I did not tell
him. What was the good? There is no satisfaction
in saying: “In murgh bisyar sakht ast.” But if I
had flung down my knife and fork with much noise
on to my plate, turned round on him suddenly&mdash;how
he would have jumped&mdash;and said, “Behold! Oh
thing, born in iniquity; this fowl is as tough as
leather.” There would have been something satisfying
in that; but I did not. He would not have understood,
and would have said, “Bôt achcha, Sahib.” So
I breathed a sigh through my clenched teeth, and ate
a macaroon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of a Cold in the Head.</div>

<p>I thought I would have a cigarette after tiffin,
and I reached to the fireplace for a piece of charcoal:
of course, I picked it up by the hot end, that is just
what anyone would do when he had a cold.</p>

<p>Then the Armenian came back from his ride, and,
because it was an impossibility for me to get any
more revolver cartridges, he had been firing off my
revolver. But that was not all; he must needs add
insult to injury.</p>

<p>“This revolver is not good,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>I asked, with deadly calm, “Perhaps you would be
kind enough to explain <em>why</em> this revolver is not good?”</p>

<p>“It does not make noise enough,” he said.</p>

<p>“If you expect a revolver to make as much noise
as a home-made rifle that nearly kicks its owner off
into space, all I can say is, your expectation exceeds
your intellect.”</p>

<p>But I don’t think he followed me in this line of
delicate sarcasm, because he merely said, “I shot at a
crow.”</p>

<p>“<em>Did</em> you?” I said; “I hope you apologised.”</p>

<p>Then that cook brought some wood for the fire;
but he crept cautiously to look through the doorway
and see if I was quiet before he ventured in. I saw
him, the villain. I am not a wild beast. Am I a wild
beast?</p>

<p>He came in again, and he tried English this time.
“Sahib, I want tea?” he said, in a trembling voice.
The maniac wished to inquire whether <em>I</em> wanted tea.
I thought, “Shall I?&mdash;shall I chill his marrow, and
make his flesh creep?” but I didn’t. I merely said
“Yes.”</p>

<p>My cold disappeared after a day or two, and I
made several sketches of the infant Prince in my note-book.
When the little tunic and busby were finished,
I borrowed them, and brought them home with me. I
buttoned up the coat and stuffed it with cotton wool,
arranging the sleeves with care, and placed the little
fur busby in a suitable position. Then I set to work to
paint them. When I had finished, I painted in the
little man’s face from my sketch-book. It was an odd-looking
little painting&mdash;a man’s costume and a baby’s
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>I took it to the Durbar and showed it to His
Highness. He seemed pleased with it, and declared
the eyes were exactly like his own. I said they were:&mdash;in
fact, I intended they should be when I was
painting them. I did another portrait of the little
Prince some years afterwards that was much more
interesting; I must speak of that later.</p>

<p>His Highness, the Amîr, could not, of course,
spare time to give me a sitting every day, so that
often a considerable interval elapsed between the
sittings. However, the portrait gradually progressed
towards completion.</p>

<p>As a painting, technically speaking, it might have
been better: but as a likeness it was not at all bad.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Reflection in the Window.</div>

<p>One day after a sitting, when luncheon was
brought, I happened to notice His Highness moving
his head from side to side. I wondered what he was
doing; then he turned to me with a smile, and said
he saw his reflection in the glass of the window,
but was surprised to find that it did not move as
he moved. He could not understand it for a moment.
Then he saw the explanation. The portrait was
standing on its easel in the room, and it was the
reflection of his effigy, not of himself, that he saw.
I thought this was a very good sign; it seemed to
show that, at any rate, I had caught the attitude and
general look of the Amîr.</p>

<p>After lunch His Highness withdrew, and I put the
easel and picture at one end of the room and sat
down at the far end with a cigar, to take a comprehensive
look at the thing. It happened to be standing
in exactly the place where the Amîr usually sits.
Presently there came running in a little Page boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
with a message from the Harem serai. He turned
to the picture at once, and said, “Sahib, Salaam
aleicoum.” Then he saw what he had done, for
everyone laughed. He seemed very much taken
aback and ran out of the room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr as an Art Critic.</div>

<p>His Highness often gave me the benefit of his
criticisms, and although he did not profess to be a
painter, his remarks were so redolent of common sense,
that they were well worth listening to. A painter
staring at his picture, day after day as it grows under
his hand, may completely overlook faults that are
obvious even to an untrained eye. Hence, I always
listened to the Amîr’s remarks with interest. He
could tell me when a thing struck him as in some way
not true, though he could not tell me exactly what
was wrong, nor in what way to remedy the defect.
These I puzzled out for myself. As an example: he
said one day that the paint had become rubbed,
showing the canvas through, and he pointed to the
spot&mdash;on the end of the nose. It was not the paint
rubbed off, but I had put a touch of high light on the
spot indicated, and the Amîr’s remark showed me
that my “high light” was too white and too strong,
or it would never have caught his eye. I altered it.</p>

<p>Another day, looking at the picture, he said it
needed something, he hardly knew what. Suddenly,
he sent a Page off to another room and the boy
returned with a Russian tea-tray which had a
picture on it&mdash;a gorgeous sunset behind some
mountains.</p>

<p>“Bibín,” said the Amîr, “See! something like
that is needed.”</p>

<p>I was nonplussed for a moment: the tea-tray was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
too awful for words. Then I saw what His Highness
meant.</p>

<p>“Sahib! shuma rast megoyèd,” I said, in admiration.
“Sir! you speak truly. I will remedy the
fault.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes I had put in a shadow behind the
head, which threw it up wonderfully. I had not
noticed, till the Amîr pointed it out, that the head had
rather the look of being cut out and stuck on the
canvas. His Highness saw there was a want of
harmony somewhere, and his tea-tray showed me
where.</p>

<p>It will be understood, therefore, that when the last
sitting was given and the last touch made, I felt a
certain amount of&mdash;nervous excitement, while I was
waiting for His Highness’s dictum.</p>

<p>The portrait was placed in a good light. His
Highness called for a large mirror, which was
placed by the side of it, and he sat for some
time comparing his reflection in the glass with the
picture.</p>

<p>Presently he said that the only fault he could find
was that I had, perhaps, given a little too much colour
to the cheeks. He said he had that colour when he
was younger, but that now he was forty-six (this was
in 1890), and his face struck him as being somewhat
paler. This did not take long to remedy, and it was
shown him again.</p>

<p>“Darust! darust!” said he&mdash;“Right!” and the
only fault now was that the picture did not speak!
He told me that Her Majesty, our Queen, had sent
him a photograph of himself, but that, in his
opinion, it was not good: that such a likeness as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
the one I had painted had never before been seen
in Afghanistan. This I thought to be quite likely,
and yet not be very great praise. Altogether, he
was, without doubt, pleased with the portrait. As
regards my own opinion: the technique or handling
was very amateurish, not that it mattered very
much, for no one knew any more about “technique”
than I did. It was like the Amîr, certainly; but I
often wondered afterwards how I could have painted
a strong head so weakly. The only explanation I
had was that the diffused light&mdash;reflections from
white walls and snow&mdash;were factors that I ought
to have considered more, and in some way or other
guarded against.</p>

<p>When the portrait was brought to my house
to be varnished, there happened to be a crowd
of patients outside, and several people, soldiers
and townsfolk, waiting inside for treatment. The
picture was escorted by a guard of soldiers: the
crowds outside murmured “Salaam aleicoum!”
as a lane was made for the procession to enter;
those inside sprang to their feet and salaamed
also.</p>

<p>A message came, ostensibly from the Sultana,
that the portrait was to be conveyed to the Harem
for her to see.</p>

<p>The Armenian, with a boldness that surprised
me, refused to allow it to leave the house unless a
written order from “Amîr Sahib” could be produced&mdash;none
arrived. Possibly, this may have been
a test on the part of the Amîr to see what I
should do: for he guards his personal dignity with
jealous care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Start on a Shooting Expedition.</div>

<p>When the last sitting was over we had lunch at
the Palace, and I was informed that, afterwards,
His Highness intended to go out shooting. Accordingly,
when lunch (or breakfast) was over the
Amîr’s shooting costume was brought by the Chamberlain
and Pages. The Amîr’s toilet is generally
a more or less public function, and I was not
required to withdraw. The coat was of olive-green
cloth, lined and trimmed with astrakhan, and ornamented
like a Hussar’s coat with gold embroidery
and shoulder knots. The boots were in the pattern
of Russian boots, long ones of soft leather that can
be wrinkled down: they were made in Kabul.</p>

<p>His Highness’s horse was waiting outside, a steady
strong-looking nag, with a padded saddle and a
gold-bedecked bridle. Two other led horses were in
readiness, each with cloth of gold thrown over the
saddle. There was a small guard of foot-soldiers
and several mounted men. One carried the Amîr’s
rifle; another a lance and shield&mdash;why, I do not
know; another, the chillim or hubble-bubble, the
vase of which was in a leather case slung to the
saddle. This was for the use of the suite, as the
Amîr rarely, if ever, smokes the chillim, and only
occasionally a cigarette. There were several Page
boys mounted: they were good riders, keeping their
seat chiefly by balance. Like most boys, they were
rather reckless, and were ready enough to exhibit
their skill for the benefit of onlookers.</p>

<p>His Highness came from the Palace. The guard
saluted, a stool was placed, and His Highness
mounted; the bystanders murmuring “Kaìri Allah!”
just as he reached the saddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a pretty sight seeing them all start, for
the day was bright and sunny: it had been pouring
with rain all the day before.</p>

<p>The Armenian and I went for a ride also, but
we did not see His Highness. The mud! In some
of the narrow lanes, where the sun shone for only a
few minutes in the day, it was like floundering
through a bog, and you came every now and again
to a seemingly bottomless hole&mdash;you did not know
there was one till you were in it. Out on the
plains it was all right; the sun had dried the surface
hard.</p>

<p>We took “the rifle” with us, but did not get a
shot at anything. I proposed shooting at a horse that
was grazing, just outside the city, on the scrubby
grass that the rain had brought up, but the Armenian
seemed to think there was just an off chance that I
might hit it, and if so I should have to disemburse
lucre for same.</p>

<p>In the evening I was sitting comfortably on the
ground in front of the fire, leaning against an
inverted chair. I found I was safer so: my chairs
were portable ones, and sometimes shut up when it
was neither necessary nor desirable. The one reliable
one had never recovered after Hakim Abdur Rashid
sat on it. On a box at my elbow I had two nice
tallow candles, one in a brass candlestick and one in a
bottle, and I was peacefully smoking and trying to
learn Persian. Quite suddenly the Armenian pounced
on one of my candles, the one in the bottle, and
hurried it out of sight.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” I said, “what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Sir, nothing up, but somebody coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“You need not take my light if they are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” he said, reproachfully, “you King’s
doctor, and people see you have candle in bottle!
Shame come for you!”</p>

<p>“Where does the shame come in?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Sir, you not know: men of Afghanistan very
fool men, a little they talk if they see.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sample Case of Cigars.</div>

<p>The arrival turned out to be a messenger from
the Palace with a letter and a parcel from His
Highness. The parcel was a sample case of cigars,
and the letter, in the Amîr’s handwriting, directed
me to smoke and choose: I was to let His Highness
know which were the best, and he would order a
supply of them.</p>

<p>The Amîr’s writing is peculiar. He uses a steel
pen, not the native reed pen: like many other
illustrious men, he cannot be considered a good
penman.</p>

<p>The next day was dull and rainy, but we had a
glorious sunset. The sky, in its depth, was a perfect
blue, which grew fainter and faded to primrose as it
neared the mountains half hid in the piled up clouds.
The summits, huge and rugged, had torn through the
layers of cloud and shone red in the sun: their bold
and rigid outlines, casting deep purple shadows, were
cut off from the calm of the sky by the heavy
clouds piled up behind them. These great masses,
though seemingly almost as solid as rock, had
softer outlines than the rugged peaks, and they
showed great billowy waves of red light and deep
shadow. Below the peaks the clouds hung in drawn-out
layers, the lights and shadows becoming lost
in grey and brown: lower, all was lost in a depth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of deep purple blue, which mingled with the rich
green brown of the darkened and foreshortened
treeless plain. Sharp against all this depth of
purple and green were the leafless branches and
myriad branchlets of the trees of Mazar, red gold
in the sun.</p>

<p>March 21st is the Mahomedan New Year’s Day.
On New Year’s Eve one of the Chief Secretaries
was announced. He entered, accompanied by some
servants carrying two trays with cloths over them.
After the usual salutations the Secretary gave me a
letter. It was from His Highness requesting my
acceptance of the accompanying presents.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Izzat” Medal.</div>

<p>The cloths were lifted and I found that His
Highness had conferred upon me the gold Afghan
Medal of Honour and had presented me with five
thousand rupees.</p>

<p>The medal was for the work I had done among
the sick during the past year, and the rupees for the
portrait.</p>

<p>From the Sultana was a gold English lever hunting
watch and chain, and six or seven yards of stuff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
the prevailing tint of which was Indian red, but
which was so woven with gold threads that it
seemed red gold. I heard that the medal was
unique: it was the only one of the kind that had
been struck.</p>

<p>I do not think I have said anything about the
coinage of Afghanistan. The ordinary medium of
exchange is the rupee. It is a smaller coin than the
kaldar, or Indian rupee, being about the size of a
shilling. Nominally, it is worth twelve annas, though
there is no such coin as an anna in circulation.
A half rupee is called a kran. The copper coins in
circulation are called pice. Five pice go to the anna.
There are sixty or more pice in a rupee, according to
the exchange, which can always be found out by
reference to the money-changers in the bazaars.
Formerly the coins were struck by hand. Quite
recently His Highness has established a minting
machine in Kabul. I think the new rupee is scarcely
as artistic as the old: it is Europeanized, and it is said
to be worth an anna less. Pice, too, are now being
made in the minting machine. The Amîr is introducing
the new rupee into circulation by paying the
soldiers of his army with that coin.</p>

<p>There is no gold Afghan coin in circulation, though
the Bokhara “Tilla,” worth about twelve shillings, is
current. Many of the richer Afghans hoard their
wealth, and for this purpose they buy Bokhara Tillas,
or bar gold, from the alluvial deposits of the Oxus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Levee on New Year’s Day.</div>

<p>On New Year’s day, “Nau Rôz,” the Amîr held a
Levee in the Palace Gardens. I went about ten
o’clock.</p>

<p>His Highness wore a white uniform, and over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
shoulders was thrown a dark green cloak, slightly
embroidered with gold. He wore the otter skin
busby and diamond star that I painted in the portrait.
He looked very handsome.</p>

<p>Every one was as gorgeous as he could make himself;
some looked uncommonly well; a few ridiculous.</p>

<p>There was a great awning of crimson and white,
supported on eleven masts. Under it were seated, in
rows&mdash;or rather kneeling, for they were in the presence
of the King&mdash;the Maliks and Governors of
neighbouring villages and towns, who had come to
salaam His Highness. These were almost all dressed
in native costumes, with turbans.</p>

<p>The Guard, who had new uniforms, were in line,
and the people of the Court were grouped about near
His Highness, who was seated in an arm-chair.</p>

<p>I had a chair to the right of His Highness the
Amîr, and somewhat behind him. The rest stood or
sat on the ground. The Armenian stood behind my
chair. The day was cold and the sky grey. I was
dressed in European costume with an overcoat, on the
left breast of which the Armenian had with great
pride fixed the medal. He wanted me to wear the
watch and chain outside as well. As there was no
sun I wore an astrakhan hat of the Royal shape
which had been presented to me. Bands with European
and native instruments played alternately. Tea
was brought to everyone by the servants, and I had a
cigar. Then came cakes and sweets. A special tray
was brought to His Highness, and he was kind enough
to send me some from it, otherwise after my first bow
and his enquiry after my health, I did not occupy
much of his attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Col. Attaullah Khan, the British Agent, who is
a very tall fine man, a Punjabi, came escorted by
his guard, and attended by his native Doctor and
his Secretary, the highly educated Munshi Amin
Ullah.</p>

<p>He made his salaam, and was invited to sit on the
Amîr’s left, on the ground. The Secretary and
Doctor were seated away under the awning.</p>

<p>Then presents were brought and laid at His Highness’s
feet. He seemed just to glance at them, and
they were taken away. There were all kinds of
things, the cost depending upon the wealth of the
giver: silk handkerchiefs, brass work, lamps, vases,
fruit, crockery; but what interested me most were
the products of the Government workshops in Mazar&mdash;rifles,
swords, saddles, boots, sun helmets, and two
tables of carved wood uncommonly well made, and
looking as though they came from Europe.</p>

<p>As a picture, the whole scene was brilliant with
colour; and the grey sky, with the delicate pink and
white of the blossoms covering the trees and the faint
green of the just budding leaves, made a very sweet
and harmonious background.</p>

<p>Presently the Amîr’s portrait was brought out
and exhibited. Afterwards breakfast (or lunch) was
brought. His Highness’s table was placed in front of
him, and a little one was brought for me. The rest
had theirs on the ground, as usual. The chief cook
waited upon me. After breakfast a copper ewer and
basin (aftabah and chillimchi) were taken to the chief
guests, and they washed their hands.</p>

<p>For the others long narrow damp towels, each
reaching from end to end of a row of guests, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
passed along, so that a dozen or more could wipe their
hands at the same moment.</p>

<p>After another cigar I rose, made my bow, and
retired, much to the Armenian’s disgust. I think
I was the first to go. Many people asked to look at
my medal, and the Commander-in-Chief, who was
some little distance from me, gave a congratulatory
smile and bow as he touched his breast.</p>

<p>I got home about half-past two; some sick people
were brought, and after a cup of tea I set to work
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Game of Chess.</div>

<p>In the evening I played chess. I had been playing
with different people, and had always been
beaten. I determined, therefore, to play the Armenian.
He knew the moves, and we sat down to a
game. We played rapidly, and he grew very excited.
He muttered in Pushtu, or shouted in a mixture of
Hindustani, Persian, and English. He swooped with
his Wazir or Queen, and cried “Kisht! check!” I
took his Queen with a Pawn, at which he was indignant:
he said it was not fair, and he wanted his
Queen back. I began to doubt if he would ever make,
so to speak, a good player; he was too impulsive: he
swooped and slaughtered right and left. We had one
game where in the end we had nothing left but a
King and a Pawn each: then he took my Pawn. I
told him the game was drawn, because I saw he would
get across and have a Castle before I could stop him;
but he said&mdash;No, he had won. I appealed to the
onlookers, and they said politely, “Undoubtedly
the game is drawn.” However, I consented to
a compromise, and allowed it to be drawn in his
favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>Chess as played in Afghanistan is slightly different
from chess as played in England.</p>

<p>In the first move, the Pawn goes only one square.
The Queen is called the “Wazir,” or Prime Minister,
and stands on the King’s <em>right</em>. The Bishop is
called the “Fil,” or Elephant. The Knight is called
“Asp,” or Horse, or sometimes the “Sowar,” that
is “Rider,” or Knight. The Castle is called the
“Rookh,” and is supposed to be a Redoubt or Fort.
Sometimes it is called the “Tôp,” or Cannon. There
is some slight difference in the castling, though I
forget exactly what, otherwise, the pieces have the
same moves as in England.</p>

<p>My “fool-horse”&mdash;the fighter, with tooth and nail
(that is to say, hoof)&mdash;developed “cracked heels.”
This was unfortunate, for I knew nothing about
horse doctoring, and he got into the habit of stumbling
and coming down on his nose. Twice did I
remain on under these circumstances, and proudly
I said to the Armenian,</p>

<p>“Behold, now! I am as a great rider among men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?” said the Armenian, “I think it you
fall off.”</p>

<p>But, alas! Pride cometh, then cometh the fall.
Then next time he came down I went over his head.
There was a sentence I had to learn in my Persian
lesson that day that seemed appropriate, it was:&mdash;“Ba
zamin ûftad, Ustoghonash rèz rèz shud,” which
means, “He fell to the earth and his bones were
broken to pieces.” Not that mine were, but they
might have been. I seemed, as it were, to have lost
confidence in my horse, and I said to the Armenian,
“This must not occur again; see to it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir! what <em>I</em> do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sell him, or shoot him.”</p>

<p>But he said No; he would report the matter to
Amîr Sahib at the next Durbar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr as a Pathologist.</div>

<p>Tuesday arrived and we went to the Durbar.
After I had saluted His Highness, and was seated,
a case of epilepsy was brought. His Highness
described to me the symptoms the man was exhibiting,
told me the Persian name of the disease, and
gave his own views as to the pathology. He told
me the old books said, that a man in this condition
was possessed by the Devil, “Shaitân;” but, that
this was, of course, absurd. He went on to say
that he considered the disease was due to an organism&mdash;probably,
animal&mdash;having found its way into
the ventricles of the brain: the irritation caused by
its presence culminating in a nervous explosion;
the outward signs of which were a convulsive seizure,
a thrusting forward of the tongue, spasm of the jaws,
a foaming at the mouth, and insensibility. He said,
he wished to administer a native medicine, but, at
the same time, I was to give such European drugs
as I thought suitable for the case.</p>

<p>I asked, then, if some wooden stethoscopes might
be made for the Hindustani assistants, as neither
of them possessed one. I had been giving them
some instructions, and had been holding classes in
the evening for the compounders. I found there
was not a great deal I could teach the Priest compounder
“Hafiz.” He was very well up in his work,
and was an intelligent man, the only one I could
really rely on in an operation.</p>

<p>Then the Armenian considered that the time had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
come to speak about the horse, and he waxed
eloquent.</p>

<p>His Highness said, “Why ride a horse so dangerous;
I have many horses.”</p>

<p>He told me he had a black horse, a remarkable
animal, whose speed was like that of a steam-engine.
This he would send for. It had been coveted by
many of the Courtiers: one wanted it for his son,
another for himself; but His Highness would not
give it to anyone. I had never seen it. The horse
was sent for. I pictured a lovely creature, like an
Arab, with a small head, slender limbs, and broad
chest. Judge of my surprise when I beheld a black
shaggy pony, all mane and tail. I thought within
myself: “They are playing it low down upon the
stranger within their gates.”</p>

<p>But, at a sign from the Amîr, the head-groom
mounted and off the pony started. He did not
gallop, canter, trot, nor walk: he simply “skated”
over the ground at terrific speed. They said he
could keep the pace up for thirty miles without
stopping, and could travel from Mazar to Kabul in
four days!</p>

<p>Hence, if one found it necessary to move from
one place to another hurriedly, this horse seemed
likely to be invaluable.</p>

<p>His Highness said that as this horse was not
beautiful I was to choose two other horses, handsome
and swift. The pony I was to keep at my
house, and the other two should be kept in his own
stable, and when I needed them I was to send for
them.</p>

<p>That black pony was uncanny. An evil spirit&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>several
evil spirits&mdash;possessed him. The first thing
he did, when we got him home, was to deliberately
untie his halter, walk off to the “fool horse,” though
he was only about half his size, and fight him. He
went so quietly and seemed so gentle&mdash;just at first:
but he was a fiend. They fought furiously, striking,
kicking, and tearing at each other with their teeth.
If we had not succeeded in separating them the
“fool horse” would have been killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Steam-engine” Pony.</div>

<p>Shortly after that, and without any hurry, he
slipped his head out of his headstall and walked off
to a horse belonging to the Armenian, a young one
he had lately bought to trade with in Kabul. The
young one was frightened, and the “Steam-engine,”
seeing it was an adversary not worthy of his steel&mdash;or
teeth&mdash;merely nipped him in the neck and walked
back again.</p>

<p>The next day I rode him to the Hospital. The
Armenian was riding a grey&mdash;a cross between an
Arab and a Kataghani, a swift animal&mdash;and one of the
compounders was on the “fool horse,” who stumbled.
When we got through the bazaars I gave the pony
his head, and off he skated. I leant back and occupied
myself in hanging on. He kept the grey at a
gallop all the way to the Hospital: about a quarter
of an hour afterwards the compounder arrived on the
“fool horse.” I saw my patients, cut off a man’s
thumb at the wrist, then we skated back again.</p>

<p>One afternoon, it was in April, as I was coming
back from seeing a patient, I met the two little
Princes, Hafiz Ullah and Amin Ullah, who were
aged respectively about nine and three. They were
in their palanquins, and there was a guard of about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
thirty soldiers. As the sun was hot, a large umbrella
was held over each Prince.</p>

<p>I pulled up my horse and saluted, and the elder of
the two Princes asked if I would not accompany them.
The Armenian and I, therefore, turned our horses and
rode with them. I wondered where we were going.</p>

<p>We marched through the streets and bazaars, the
guard flourishing their almond sticks to clear people
out of the way, till we reached the gates leading into
the grounds around the Temple or Mosque of Mazar.</p>

<p>Here the Armenian and I dismounted, and I
walked by the side of the elder Prince’s palanquin:
the Armenian came behind. The Prince’s Kaffir
Page boys were there, his tutor, and other young
men, officers of his household. I had never been so
near the Mosque before. They say it is about two
hundred years old. It is truly Oriental in style,
with cupola, pierced stone (lattice work) windows,
and minarets. The blue-stone&mdash;or porcelain&mdash;bricks
of which it is built are of different tints, the contrasting
tints being arranged in patterns. In the
immediate grounds, or square, of the Temple, were
a number of shops, or booths, where they sold handkerchiefs,
porcelain articles, and strings of beads,
or rosaries. In the front of each shop was an
awning of rush matting, supported on two poles.
The sun shone brilliantly, and in the distance the
mountains glimmered shadowy blue in the heated
air. The crowds of people, and the shopkeepers,
salaamed as the Princes went by. We marched
through and on into the Park of Mazar&mdash;the Chahar
Bagh. The park is about a mile in width each way.
We went along the paths under the trees till we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
reached a large open space, where I found there was
to be a wrestling contest. At one end of the space
was a mound or platform, about six feet above the
level. On it were spread carpets; and supported
on poles was a brilliantly-coloured awning to keep
off the glare of the sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spectators at the Wrestling-match.</div>

<p>There were two chairs for the Princes and a chair
was given to me. The guard was arranged round,
the Page boys stood in a line behind us, and the
others, including the Armenian and the tutor, were
seated on the ground.</p>

<p>The tutor was a smart young fellow, very polished
in manner, who used to cheat at cards in the most
amusing and barefaced way. I had met him before.
Around the open space were crowds of spectators, all
in national costume: most of them with white turbans,
long loose coats of various colours, and white, baggy
pyjamas, tight at the ankle. The front ranks were
seated, cross-legged, on the ground; behind them
were rows standing. The ground sloped upwards for
about three feet, so that all could see. Forming a
background were the trees, all covered with green, for
the summer comes rapidly in Turkestan; the roses
were blooming in April.</p>

<p>First, the band played. The musicians stood in the
centre, their musical instruments being drums and
pipes, or flageolets. The latter were large, black
instruments, bound with brass, and with a tone not
unlike that of the bagpipes.</p>

<p>They played an Afghan tune, most quaint to my
ear, and the drums beat rhythmically, but with a rhythm
quite different from anything I had heard in Europe.</p>

<p>Then there came forward about thirty Afghan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
soldiers, belonging to an artillery regiment. They
were to dance an Afghan dance. Their dress was the
usual costume of the Pathan soldier&mdash;the conical cap
and small turban, white vest hanging loose over the
white pyjamas, and a short jacket. The Princes, by
the way, both wore military uniforms and belts, with
gem-bedecked buckles, and astrakhan hats of the
Royal shape. The tutor wore a plain grey tunic and
an astrakhan hat of a different shape. I sported a
turban, for I was afraid of the sun, and the turban is
an excellent protection to the head. The Kaffir Pages
had grey tunics and trousers and soft grey felt hats.
The Princes and their suite therefore were European
in dress.</p>

<p>The thirty soldiers formed a ring round the
musicians; the drums beat a sort of slow march, and
the dancers walked slowly round singing a chant in
falsetto&mdash;one-half sang a verse, the other half
answered. Presently the pipes began their shrill
wailing, and the dancers moved faster, with a step
something like a mazurka. Quicker and quicker
grew the music, and quicker and quicker the dance:
turbans and shoes were tossed off without a pause.
The circle widened and lessened at regular intervals,
and arms were waved and hands clapped simultaneously.
The dancers became excited, uttering at
intervals a sharp cry. Still continuing the mazurka
step, every dancer at each momentary pause in the
music whirled round on his toes to the right, then to
the left. Some were, of course, more graceful than
others. One in particular, I noticed&mdash;a huge man
with a short black beard, and long wavy black hair
parted on one side; he was a most enthusiastic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
graceful dancer. It was a curiously stirring sight. One
could imagine fiery Afghans worked up to a pitch
of excitement almost approaching frenzy. In time
the dancers became exhausted, and dropped off one
by one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wrestling: Turkoman v. Mazari.</div>

<p>Then came a dance by about a dozen boys, aged
about thirteen or fourteen; they wore their hair long,
and were dressed as girls. I was not interested.
Their dancing was not to be compared with, though it
somewhat resembled, that of the European ballet.</p>

<p>When the dances were over, tea was brought to us
under the awning, and then the wrestling commenced.
This was excellent.</p>

<p>First came Turkoman soldiers matched against
Mazarîs. They were barefooted, and wore the small
skull cap of the Turkoman, short cotton breeches, and
long loose coat unfastened.</p>

<p>A pair advanced and took their stand a few paces
apart, near the Prince’s platform. They watched each
other a moment, then warily sidled round. Suddenly
one rushed forward and they closed, each seizing
the other by the collar and elbow. Rarely could a
wrestler manage to get both his arms under those of
his opponent: when he did, the bout was over in a
moment. By collar and elbow each tried to twist the
other off his feet or trip him. It was necessary to
throw the opponent, so that he should be flat on his
back on the ground. Often there was a long writhing
struggle when they both were down, till one could
disengage. Some of the bouts grew very exciting,
but the Turkomans invariably came off winners, they
were so immensely strong, with such Herculean
muscles. The Mazarîs showed plenty of pluck and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
endurance, but they were no match for the Turkomans.
Finally, seeing that the Mazarîs were out-matched,
the elder Prince pitted the Turkomans
one against the other. The men were not very
keen upon wrestling their comrades.</p>

<p>There happened to be two Turkomans of enormous
size; the biggest men I ever saw. It would have
been folly for anyone there to stand up to either of
them, and the Prince, after some persuasion, induced
them to have a bout together.</p>

<p>They stood up&mdash;great giants&mdash;and walking deliberately
up to one another they grappled. There was
no sudden movement. It was a sheer trial of
strength. At the end of the first round neither had
any advantage. After that they got warmed to their
work, and each grew a little jealous of the other.
They commenced now in good earnest, and what had
gone before was play to what came after. The
knotted muscles, the clenched jaw, and the distended
veins showed the enormous strain of the mighty
heaves. At last, with a supreme effort, one threw
the other backwards, and, like the fall of two great
oaks, the giants came to the ground together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kabuli Wrestling.</div>

<p>Then came the Kabulis, who wrestled stripped
except for a cincture round the waist. Theirs was a
more complicated style than that of the Turkomans:
they seemed in excellent training.</p>

<p>One Kabuli, a well-built fellow, threw man after
man who came forward, though each was a practised
wrestler. He had wonderful powers of endurance.
The last man but one who came against him was a
strong young fellow. He heaved the champion
off the ground, carried him a step or two and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
to fling him down. He might as well have tried to
fling a tiger down. How it came about I could not
tell, they were so locked and writhing, but in a second
or two the champion was on his feet and the young
man down. These men belonged to the artillery
regiment that had danced.</p>

<p>During the wrestling, when the spectators became
excited, and a popular champion was in the ring,
they shouted for success or groaned for failure nearly
as much as Englishmen would have done.</p>

<p>Then came the distribution of prizes. To the
successful wrestlers the Prince gave Turkoman coats
of brilliant colours&mdash;such as the Oriental loves.</p>

<p>While the sports were going on the Commander-in-Chief
and some Officers arrived. They saluted the
Princes and bowed to me; but they would not sit on
the ground while I had a chair. In the presence of
the Amîr they had, at first, been greatly offended at
sitting lower than I, and had made some remark on
the subject after I had left: they received, however,
such a severe reprimand from His Highness that
they never repeated it.</p>

<p>When the sun began to set the air became cool,
and the Princes rose and took their departure. I
accompanied their Highnesses, leaving the Commander-in-Chief
and the Officers in the Park.</p>

<p>On the following day, after I had finished my work, I
heard that the infant Prince, Mahomed Omer, was
leaving the Harem Serai, where he had been living
since his recovery from the vaccination, to take
possession of a house that had been freshly prepared
for him. I sent to enquire if he would receive me that
afternoon. This may seem a great deal of ceremony
when a baby is the principal personage, but as a
matter of fact it was really paying a ceremonial visit
to the Sultana. She being a Mussulman, of course
did not give audience to anyone: her son received for
her. At the time of which I write the baby Prince
certainly took precedence of his brothers, the Princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Hafiz Ullah and Amin Ullah, who were in Turkestan;
but whether he now takes precedence of his two eldest
brothers, Habibullah and Nasrullah, I cannot say.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reception by the Infant Prince.</div>

<p>I was informed that the Prince would receive me.
I started accompanied by the Armenian. The house
was near the Harem Serai.</p>

<p>We were first shown into an outer garden, containing
a house in which lived my small friend
Mahomed Omer, son of the Deputy Commander-in-Chief
in Kabul. Mahomed Omer was the infant
Prince’s “Commander-in-Chief.” He was dressed in
scarlet and gold, and marshalling the Kaffir Page boys
in military order, he fancied himself quite a soldier.
From this garden a screened doorway led into an inner
and larger garden, the Prince’s. In this were two
adjoining pavilions, or summer-houses, one larger and
the other smaller. They were open and airy, without
doors or window sashes, and were carpeted, and hung
with crimson and white. The larger pavilion had
about a dozen chairs arranged against the wall:
there was no other furniture. It was apparently a
waiting-room, or perhaps a reception-room for visitors
of lower rank. As no one had arrived I sat there
with the Armenian.</p>

<p>Presently we heard a trumpet, and a few minutes
after the hoarse voice of an officer as he shouted
some word of command.</p>

<p>The Armenian said,</p>

<p>“Shahzada, Sahib, meaiyad.” “The Prince is
coming.”</p>

<p>First entered the Kaffir Pages, marshalled by
Mahomed Omer, then came the Prince, carried in
the arms of the old Hakim Abdul Wahid&mdash;the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
Hakim in the country, so the Amîr used to say,
who was really learned. Then came three of the
nurses: the young one I have spoken of and two
older ones. These were brought from the Harem
Serai in a covered palanquin: after them two or three
officials in uniform, whose faces I recognized, though
in what capacity they served I did not know; and
lastly, the guard of a hundred soldiers.</p>

<p>I came outside the larger pavilion to receive
the Prince, and followed him into the smaller one.
In this was a couch covered with silk and supported
on silvered legs, modelled in the shape of conventional
or heraldic birds. There was a child’s high
chair of carved oak with a tapestry seat in the
room, and a small table with ornaments on it in
the corner.</p>

<p>The Prince was placed in the chair, and he sat
upright like a little man nine months old. He wore
a tunic of gold-embroidered silk, white pyjamas and
astrakhan hat, of the royal shape. In his hand
he had a gold rattle.</p>

<p>A chair was placed for me, and the others stood or
sat on the ground. After the usual courteous enquiries
and some conversation, in which, of course, Hakim
Abdul Wahid was the Prince’s deputy, a large tray
of sweetmeats with loaves of sugar was placed at
my feet. I do not quite know the significance of
this custom: I know it is symbolical, and I think
to symbolize the wish of the host that his guest’s
future existence, in this world and the next, may be
filled with sweet emotions. By and bye, little Prince
Amin Ullah arrived, accompanied by his tutor, but with
very little State, compared with that of his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to Prince Hafiz Ullah.</div>

<p>After the inevitable tea, I took leave of their
Highnesses and departed. On the way home, I
saw the tutor of Prince Hafiz Ullah at the window
of his Prince’s house. He smiled and beckoned me
to come in. There was a sentry at the door, and
the Armenian and I went in. The house was not
so good as that of the Baby Prince, nor was it as
good as mine.</p>

<p>Prince Hafiz Ullah was seated on the ground on
a leopard skin, and as there were no chairs I also
sat on the ground on a sort of mattress. The
Armenian went off to my house, which was quite
near, for some cigarettes, and I stayed with the
Prince for about an hour and a-half, till the heat
of the afternoon was less. His Highness courteously
said that I was not a servant in Afghanistan, but his
friend and his brother. He asked if I would go
again with him to the park to see the wrestling, as
the sports were not over.</p>

<p>As this was my first visit to little Hafiz Ullah
Khan, he asked me to accept a present: a leather
pocket-book, a pocket-knife, and a walking-stick,
the best he had.</p>

<p>I have often been somewhat surprised at the
inability of most Afghans to distinguish a genuine
article from an imitation. Merchants make a harvest
in the country, by taking advantage of this want of
knowledge.</p>

<p>At half-past four we started for the park. The
wrestling and dancing were a repetition of the exhibition
of the day before. The Turkomans still carried
all before them. They were not all such hugely
tall men, though they were all excessively muscular.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
There were no Kabuli wrestlers this day, but, as I
happened to say I thought the Kabulis were specially
good wrestlers, the Prince gave orders for a display
of Kabuli wrestling for the morrow.</p>

<p>We got home at half-past seven in the evening,
and I sent some photographs to the Prince&mdash;I had
nothing else to give him&mdash;one of our Queen, one of
the Prince of Wales, and two or three more that I
had. He was pleased, as he is fond of pictures,
and he was particularly interested in the portraits
of the Queen and Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>The next day was Friday, the Sabbath, and the
Prince sent me an invitation to lunch with him in
the Palace Gardens. His Highness, the Amîr, was
away out on the plains shooting, and there was
no garden attached to the Prince’s house. Two
soldiers came to escort me&mdash;not with fixed bayonets,
for I was not a prisoner, at any rate, not nominally,
though perhaps actually; for the position was,
with all its interest, not very far removed from
honourable confinement.</p>

<p>The sun shone brilliantly, and we sat under the
almond trees. The Prince, in native costume, sat
on a sort of divan with carpet and cushions. I
had a chair and table. The tutor and others were
there, and the guards were posted around under the
trees. I smoked cigarettes and talked. It was very
pleasant, surrounded as we were by flowers and grass,
and there were so many trees that we seemed almost
in the heart of a wood. I actually saw the Prince
laugh!&mdash;for the first time. He was a dignified and
polished little man, and has, the Amîr says&mdash;with one
other son&mdash;the “Royal manner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>At one o’clock lunch was brought.</p>

<p>Afterwards the Prince asked if I would accompany
him to the Chahar Bagh, to see the sports again. I
said I should enjoy doing so, and he went away with
his tutor to be attired in “purple and fine linen,” or
in other words, in European military dress. They
were some time gone, and I wandered about under
the trees by myself.</p>

<p>When the Prince returned we started. Being the
Sabbath there were a greater number of spectators
than on the previous occasions. So much time was
taken up in finding suitable Mazarîs to oppose the
muscular Turkomans, that there was no opportunity
for the Kabuli wrestlers to come into the ring.
Otherwise the dancing and wrestling were a repetition
of the former days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Mother of Prince Hafiz Ullah.</div>

<p>When we got home the Prince sent me some
oranges, and a Russian knife, fork, and spoon, in a
case, and a Turkestan cap embroidered with gold,
worked by his mother. This lady, a wife of His
Highness’s, is from Kaffristan. She is said to be
one of the most beautiful women in the country, and
is called, on account of her perfect pink and white
complexion, “The Pomegranate Flower.”</p>

<p>I made a careful pencil drawing of the Prince one
day. He is a fair-haired little fellow, with good
features and dark eyes. It was a pretty picture, and
I heard that His Highness was very pleased. The
Sultana, they said, was not so well pleased: the
Prince is not her son.</p>

<p>About this time, it was in April, I had some
trouble with one of the Generals, a fat man&mdash;not
that I object to fat men unless they interfere with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
me&mdash;with a voice like that of a full-grown bull.
This fat man attempted to bully me.</p>

<p>I reached the Hospital that morning at ten a.m.,
having seen thirty or forty patients at my own place
first. General <span class="lock">M&mdash;&mdash;</span> <span class="lock">A&mdash;&mdash;</span> Khan, who was visiting
the Hospital, enquired why I did not come earlier.
I politely explained that I was seeing patients at my
own house. He said I ought to come to the Hospital
first, and attend to the others afterwards. I was
surprised and somewhat annoyed, and looking him
in the face, I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Chira?” “Why?” He let the matter drop.</p>

<p>We then went into the different wards, or rooms,
where the patients were, and he said that such and
such men had been in the Hospital for so long, why
did I not cure them and send them out. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Because their disease does not admit of cure,”
and added, through the Interpreter, “Tell him he can
take that, and that, and that man away, if he likes.”</p>

<p>I had no intention of being cruel to the men;
speaking in English it did not strike me they would
understand, though of course they did when it was
interpreted. They seemed to give up hope at once.
One shut his eyes and died the same day, another the
next. I could, at first, hardly believe the report when
I heard it: then I cursed that fat man.</p>

<p>When we had gone the round of the patients
we came out into the garden. There he stood, this
man, surrounded by his staff, and he commenced to
take me to task. He said I was to give the patients
<em>good</em> medicine and see that I cured them&mdash;one had
Bright’s disease, another advanced Phthisis, and so on!
and was continuing his tirade, when it struck me quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
suddenly&mdash;for I am a mild man&mdash;that I was being ill-treated.
At once I thirsted for his blood with a
dreadful thirst&mdash;the effect of the climate probably&mdash;and
I desired greatly to assault him with fire arms
or with steel. Fortunately, I had neither at hand,
or the situation might have become complicated.
The Persian I had learnt went back on me, as it
were, and I had to speak English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Power of the Amîr’s Name.</div>

<p>“Does this son of a pig, whose ancestors were
pigs for many generations; this iniquitous mass of
vileness, with much body and little brain, does
he&mdash;&mdash;;” but this was enough for the Armenian,
he guessed at the rest, and he turned on the General.</p>

<p>In vituperation&mdash;for volume of sound and rapidity
of words&mdash;I never met the Armenian’s equal. I have
heard talk of the ladies of Billingsgate, and I should
like to put one in the ring with the Armenian.</p>

<p>It grew alarming. I thought so, and so did the
General. He backed and looked exceedingly uncomfortable.
He tried feebly to stem the torrent: he
might as well have tried to stop the Kabul river when
swollen by the melting snows. Then he essayed the
playful, he smiled an apologetic smile and offered me
a rose: and still the Armenian foamed:&mdash;The whole
matter should come before Amîr Sahib, he was the
only master in Afghanistan; if he had a complaint
let him bring it then, and so on. Many times the
General tried to speak, to explain, to remonstrate, but
straight ahead went the Armenian, never pausing one
moment. At last the General thought he had better
go, and he went.</p>

<p>He had not escaped yet: a letter from the
Armenian followed him. In it he was solemnly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
warned never to attempt that sort of thing again
(he never did), that a European will not bear it, and
that this particular European would proceed at once,
on the slightest attempt at a repetition of the offence,
to “very much kick and blow.”</p>

<p>At the next Durbar the General happened to be
standing not very far from my chair, and the
Armenian said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>“The English doctor wishes to speak to Amîr
Sahib about that little affair at the Hospital.”</p>

<p>The General said, “For God sake don’t let him.
I am not his master; I am his slave, his dog, his
anything!”</p>

<p>So the matter ended.</p>

<p>While the Amîr was out shooting on the plains,
one of the Page boys was thrown from his horse and
the inner end of his collar-bone was dislocated upwards.
His Highness on seeing the displacement
said there was no need to send for the English
doctor.</p>

<p>“Bandages,” he said, “are useless. Leave it
alone.” He was quite right.</p>

<p>On April the 22nd, began the Mahomedan fast,
“Ramazàn.” They fast for a month, neither eating,
drinking, nor smoking during the day. Directly the
twilight commences, however, that is when they can
just no longer distinguish a white from a black
thread, they commence, and go on pretty much all
night.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the year had been very cool; cloudy,
windy, and rainy, so that there was much less sickness
than usual in the month. Generally both
during and after Ramazàn there is a great prevalence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of fever and bowel complaints. The first thing an
Afghan does, when he breaks his fast in the evening,
is to light the chillim and fill his lungs with tobacco
smoke. It is a tremendously big dose, and often
produces serious consequences, such as giddiness,
vomiting, and insensibility. During the fast they
brought a man to me one evening on a charpoy.
He was a great big fellow, and they said he was
insensible from smoking. He was dead. The dose of
tobacco he had taken had been too much for his heart.
As soon as I said he was dead, the brother and the
other soldiers who had brought him were greatly
upset. They wailed and wept aloud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Evening Durbar.</div>

<p>The first Durbar I went to after His Highness’s
return from his shooting expedition on the plains
was during the month of Ramazàn. The Durbar
was, of necessity, held in the evening, at seven
o’clock, and, the weather being fine, it was held
outside the Palace, in the gardens.</p>

<p>For some reason or other His Highness, I could
tell, was pleased with me. For instance, in addressing
me, he used a familiar form of expression, such
as one uses to a friend. He said, it was quite a
long time since he had seen me. He enquired if
the Hindustani assistants were working well, and
congratulated himself that the year was cool and
healthy compared with the last. He said he himself
did not fast during Ramazàn: that there were duties
a King owed to his people, for when a man fasts
he has not that control over himself and his temper
that a King, with life and death in his hands, should
have. He said, “Ramazàn” should be called
“Marazàn.”&mdash;“Maraz” meaning “disease.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Armenian brought forward two or three
people on whom I had had to operate for “stone,” and
exhibited them with much pride. His Highness was
pleased, and gave presents to the patients. One, I
remember, received a horse and a hundred rupees.</p>

<p>The Durbar was one of the most striking and
picturesque sights I have seen. The background
was formed by the deep shadows of the trees: under
a brilliantly coloured awning, lit up by a multitude
of lamps, sat some two hundred officers, in every
kind of uniform, resplendent with gold embroidery;
and at intervals, around the awning and Palace,
stood an Afghan soldier in native costume, holding
a blazing torch in one hand and an oil flask in the
other, and the gleam from the torches on the
billowy masses of leaf gave those soft touches of
light in the background which prevent it being heavy.</p>

<p>We had dinner somewhat early, as the men had
been fasting all day. When we got home the Armenian
gave an explanation as to why the Amîr was
so particularly charming. It was this:&mdash;During the
shooting expedition, a great deal of wild pig had
been killed, and the chief Cook sent a messenger
to enquire whether I would have roast pork for
dinner. I was highly indignant, thinking, that as
the pig is unclean, an insult was intended. I
ordered the messenger to be thrashed&mdash;he was the
bearer of evil tidings&mdash;and threatened direful things
if such a message were repeated. The Sultana then
sent for the Armenian and enquired if I would not
like a young pig or two, and whether it were not a
fact that Christians ate pig.</p>

<p>The Armenian said that Christians were indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
allowed by their religion to do so; but that neither
Christian Priests nor Christian Doctors ever suffered
anything unclean to pass their lips!!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Attempted Vendetta: the Result.</div>

<p>The same evening a man was brought on a charpoy
suffering great pain from a “strangulated hernia.”
To save his life it was necessary to operate that night.
He was moved to the Hospital, where all the instruments
were, and I did the operation by the light of
two or three tallow candles. The next morning the
brother of the patient was lying in wait for me at the
Hospital with several large knives, seeking to slay
me. He said I had killed his brother!</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” I explained, “I have saved
his life.”</p>

<p>Then the Armenian came forward in all his strength.</p>

<p>“Harem Zada!” he shouted, “thou base-born
scoundrel, thy <em>Father</em> could not speak in the Sahib’s
presence!” and he laid his stick across the man’s
shoulders with such vigour and energy that presently
he broke it. He then flung the pieces at him and
told him to “get”&mdash;“Birau” in Persian. He “got”
accordingly.</p>

<p>Coming back from the Hospital we met an old
lady walking. She was well dressed but wore no veil.
I knew her very well to speak to, but who she was I
didn’t quite know. I had heard that she was nurse to
the Amîr when he was a child. She seemed equally at
home in the Harem and in the Durbar. The Armenian
related the incident at the Hospital, and she was
suitably indignant and sympathetic. Perhaps she did
not treat me with that profound respect one would
think was the due of a distinguished Foreigner, for she
called me “Buchcha,” “Youngster”!!! I overlooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
it; for the opportunity of speaking to a lady was rare,
and I enjoyed it in direct proportion to its rarity.</p>

<p>The next Durbar evening during Ramazàn was
cold and showery. His Highness sat at the window
of the Palace. I was invited inside. The scent was
sweet from great clusters of roses arranged in vases.
After dinner (we had two kinds of ice pudding, among
other things) an Usbàk was ushered in, bringing a
design he had drawn on paper for a wall decoration&mdash;flowers
and leaves treated conventionally.</p>

<p>His Highness examined the design and said it
was not bad and it was not good. This just about
expressed my own opinion. The drawing was good
but the colours were gaudy and clashed with one
another. His Highness said he had some work of
that kind done by a Kabuli which he would show
me, and he sent for it.</p>

<p>It was an illuminated Manuscript book, and the
cover inside and out was painted with flowers and
birds treated decoratively. It was beautiful. The
drawing was excellent; the colouring was quite harmonious,
and the balance of each design was, to my
eye, perfect. I said I had never seen anything of the
kind better. The book itself, I was told, was His
Highness’s diary.</p>

<p>During the evening some presents were laid at
His Highness’s feet. Among them were two huge
loaves of white sugar, about 20 lbs. each. These he
directed to be given to me. Knowing something about
the meaning of the custom, I was very pleased.</p>

<p>Before we left, His Highness said that shortly
after the termination of Ramazàn we should leave
Mazar for Kabul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>His Highness had promised me leave of absence
for some months after his arrival in Kabul, and when
I got home that night I grew enthusiastic in my description
to the Armenian of the wonders and sights of
London. After talking some time, I said I had seen a
man seize the back of a chair with his teeth, hold it
out straight, and put another on the top of it. The
Armenian was not to be outdone. He said he had
seen a man take a charpoy&mdash;a bedstead&mdash;balance it on
one leg on the tip of his tongue, and then dance!
He also described to me a curious European sweetmeat
that he had met with in his travels.</p>

<p>“I saw him in Lahore,” he said. “Like this you
catch him, tear him up, and he is call ‘Bang’!”</p>

<p>I concluded that he wished to describe the ordinary
Christmas cracker.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of Ramazàn.</div>

<p>On the evening of May 20th the fast of Ramazàn
was over, and a certain number of guns were fired.
The next day was a Festival. It was intensely hot,
and His Highness held a Reception in the Palace
Gardens. Wishing to lay a present before him, for
those I ordered from London had not arrived, I
painted a portrait of myself, which His Highness was
pleased to accept. He sent me some apricots from his
own plate by Malek, the favourite Page boy.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning the infant Prince,
Mahomed Omer, was brought to the Reception. His
Page boys, of whom there were a dozen or more, were
dressed in <em>Scotch</em> dress with kilts and white solar
helmets. Everyone stood as the little Prince was
carried up to the Amîr. This caught my attention
at the time, for it was not usual for all to stand
when the other two little Princes entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>When I left I went on to the gardens of the
Harem Serai to pay a complimentary visit to the
Sultana. Here a tray full of sweetmeats and
sugar was laid at my feet, and the Armenian took
care it should be conveyed to my house and
promptly devoured.</p>

<p>A day or two after the termination of the Fast, I
saw my neighbour opposite, the Mirza Abdur Rashid,
superintending the packing of some of His Highness’s
valuables&mdash;diamonds, shawls, and furs, for transport to
Kabul. Accordingly, I gave orders at the Hospital
to pack up certain of the drugs and instruments; those
that I needed. Some were left for the use of the
Hindustani who was to remain behind and attend
to the sick of the regiments which were to garrison
Mazar.</p>

<p>The Armenian then set to work to pack all my
household belongings, including the carpets; and he
obtained from His Highness the necessary orders
for pack-horses, both for my baggage and the
Hospital stores.</p>

<p>On the 24th of May I heard cannon firing; on
that day the troops marched out of Mazar to camp on
the plains, on the first stage to Kabul. I endeavoured
to ride to the Hospital to attend the sick, but every
road was so crowded with loaded camels, pack-horses,
and mules, that there was no way of getting there, and
I had to return. The same day the Amîr sent me a
beautiful little bay horse to share with the “Steam-engine”
pony the labour of carrying me to Kabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Guard of Amazons.</div>

<p>A fortnight after the troops had marched out on
to the plains, the Sultana with the other ladies of the
Harem left Mazar. They started soon after daybreak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Their guard consisted not only of a body of the
Amîr’s soldiers, but of a regiment of mounted
Amazons, some two hundred, the female slaves and
servants of the Harem. These rode on men’s saddles,
were veiled, and wore on the head, over the veil, solar
helmets, or felt hats. Each was armed with a sabre
and a carbine. A syce, or groom, was told off to look
after each three horses.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards His Highness and the Court,
including myself, started on the journey. We saw
little or nothing of the Harem and guard, for they
kept two days’ march ahead of the main body during
the whole journey.</p>

<p>It was June 13th when we started. The Armenian
and I were up before daybreak superintending the
loading up of the medical stores and my own baggage.
We hoped to get well on the march before the heat of
the day commenced, but the men, from want of practice,
were so slow and clumsy in loading the pack-horses,
that our start was delayed till nine o’clock. It was
then getting very hot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tropical Heat: the Whirlwind.</div>

<p>The first march was short, and soon after midday
we reached the camping ground on the plains, some
few miles out of Mazar. I had thought my first ride
over these plains when I came to Mazar was a hot
one; that was in May&mdash;this was in June!</p>

<p>I dismounted and stood in the sun while some of
the servants commenced unloading the horses, and
others attempted to put up my tent. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
Asiatics, in their native climate: I was a Londoner,
and I raised my sun helmet every minute or two,
hoping to catch a little breeze on my head, but
there was not the slightest breath. After standing
some time, I began to wonder, in an abstract way,
which would give out first&mdash;the heart or the nervous
system&mdash;that is to say, whether it would be a faint
or a sun-stroke. The Armenian, seeing my distress,
brought me the portable iron chair that the fat
Hakim had ruined, but I found one might as well
seek rest on the bars of the kitchen grate when a
dinner is in process of preparation. I therefore
stood up again&mdash;suddenly.</p>

<p>“When, oh, when, will they get my tent up?” I
asked of my secret soul. Receiving no answer, I
begged the Armenian to hurry the men, calling his
attention to the fact that I was a European, “very
soft man likes flower, and heat is hurt it.” At last
the tent was up, and thankfully I staggered into its
welcome shade.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” I gasped, “carry me out.” For
the tent, put up on the red-hot plain at midday, felt
like a baker’s oven on Good Friday eve. I have never
been in a baker’s oven on Good Friday eve, but I
know what it is like.</p>

<p>They did not carry me out, but the Armenian
brought me a charpoy, also burning hot. I lay quite
still on it, simmered gently, and waited for death.</p>

<p>At last, it must have been after several years, I
fancy, a wind came: it was a scorching one; there
was no “healing in its breath,” and I dried up still
more. Then a whirlwind and a pillar of dust came
sweeping across the camp, tearing out the tent-pegs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
and overturning the tents in its course. This roused
me, and I crawled to the door of the tent to see if the
Amîr’s wigwam had escaped. His Highness was not
in a tent, but in a khirgar that had been prepared
some days before. It was interlaced with shrubs; and
water had been brought, with considerable trouble, in
a trench or stream from Mazar. Men outside the
khirgar were constantly throwing up the water with
wooden shovels on to the leafy covering. The khirgar
had escaped the whirlwind.</p>

<p>The Armenian went off to try and get me something
to drink or eat, for we had had no breakfast.
All that the chief of the Commissariat Department
could give him was a small piece of bread. He begged
us not to inform His Highness, and promised that
everything should be in readiness the next day. After
a search, the Armenian discovered that my rascally
cook had concealed some mutton in a dirty cloth: this
he brought me, with some brown-looking snow water,
and a little whiskey from the medical stores. I ate,
drank, and was thankful.</p>

<p>At four in the afternoon a piece of ice arrived&mdash;the
ice is saved from the winter in ice pits&mdash;and half an hour
afterwards the Amîr sent me some ice pudding, which
I devoured rapidly before it all became water. At five
came dinner, but then I was at one mind with the
Armenian: he said, “My wish is not I eat: very
much drink I take it.”</p>

<p>At seven in the evening the troops marched off
again, for the Amîr had decided to travel at midnight
to escape the heat. There were a great many of us:
the Court, the Harem, the army, and the baggage of
us all. For some time before, notice had been given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
to the towns and villages on the route to lay in stores
of grain and firewood, and to gather in their flocks
from the mountains. There were of us about eight
thousand men, ten thousand horses, three thousand
camels, and three or four elephants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Midnight Marching: Stopped on the Road.</div>

<p>When the troops had gone my men commenced
loading up the pack-horses again. They took three
hours over it, and many of the packs fastened up in
the dark slipped and fell after we started: this necessitated
a halt each time to reload. I was not in a
cheerful state, either of mind or body, for the heat
had been too much for me. I had fever rather badly,
and was aching in every bone.</p>

<p>It was pitch dark; I could not see my horse’s
head nor my own hand held up. Before we got
out of the camp on to the road I heard a pack-horse
that had broken loose tearing about like a
mad thing. We could tell where he was by the
clattering of his chain. Once, in the darkness, he
rushed close by me. I was convinced he would
charge into some one, probably me, because no one
could set my leg when it was broken. However,
we got on to the road at last: we could tell it by
the different ring of the horses’ hoofs.</p>

<p>The baggage slipped and a pack tumbled off so
frequently, that at last I had not patience to wait with
the baggage men while they loaded up again, and the
Armenian and I rode on accompanied by a soldier. I
had operated on this man some time before; he therefore
politely came two days’ journey with me.</p>

<p>We had not ridden very far when suddenly out of
the darkness came the challenge in Pushtu,</p>

<p>“Sû-kè?” “Who goes there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a sentry with orders to allow no one to pass
till the Amîr had gone by!</p>

<p>“When is he going?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“Khuda medanad!” “God knows!” was the answer.</p>

<p>This was cheerful; and I said a great deal in
English. There we sat in the dark: we couldn’t go
on, for the man would not let us. The annoying part
was that his General, who had a tent somewhere near,
was that very man who tried to bully me in the
Hospital. I said to the Armenian,</p>

<p>“Tell him to report to the fat scoundrel who I
am.” The man then shouted to someone whom we
could not see to take the report. After some minutes,
word was brought back that the General was asleep!</p>

<p>“Wake the devil, then!” I shouted, for I was burning
and aching with fever, and we had been waiting
already half an hour. They did not dare to, they said.
The sentry communed within himself, and presently
said that, as I had attended him in a severe illness and
had given him good medicine and made him well, he
would therefore risk punishment for my sake and let
me pass. He hesitated about letting the Armenian
and soldier go by too, but finally yielded, on its
being explained to him how impossible it was for me
to travel alone. I never heard that he was punished.</p>

<p>We rode on again, and on for four hours, and I
had to hang on to the pommel of the saddle. At last,
after trying to moisten parched lips with a dried-up
tongue, I said to the Armenian:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Look here! You will have to make some
different arrangements from this. I can’t stand it.
It is all very well for you fellows: you are as hard as
nails and are used to it. I am not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir, I very sorry. What <em>I</em> do.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. You must do something; or else
I must appeal to the Amîr.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hut: Impure Water.</div>

<p>I was miserable, and, like a child, struck at the
nearest. The Armenian asked if I would lie down and
sleep for an hour, for, as far as he could judge, we
had come only about half-way. A little further on
we saw something darker than the sky, and riding
up we made out that it was a hut, a little way off
the road. We could hear a trickle of water, and
by feeling around found a ditch or irrigation channel,
or something of the sort&mdash;we couldn’t see what&mdash;near
the hut. With feverish haste I dismounted,
scooped up three or four cupfuls and gulped it
down. “Here go the microbes,” I thought. I drank
knowingly; who would not? burning with fever, in a
tropical heat: but that drink nearly cost me my life.
However, the “microbes” lay low for a few days.
The Armenian then went off to the hut and hammered
at the door. After some time he roused the
inmates, and we heard them moving and speaking.
Presently the door opened, and a Turkoman, with
a lamp in his hand, appeared.</p>

<p>The Armenian told him to light a fire at once and
make some tea, as there was a Sirdar of the Court
outside with fever. Very soon the tea was brought,
and I drank several cupfuls of the hot liquid. Then
I took off my spurs and helmet, and lying on the
ground by the stream, put my revolver wrapped in
a cloak under my head, went off into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>By-and-bye I heard a cock crow, and dimly saw
that the moon had risen. Later on, I was dreamily
conscious of a trampling, and trampling, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
incessant neighing. I remember thinking how
wearisome it was, that incessant neighing.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a terrific scream, and I was
broad awake in a moment. I found, in the dim light
of dawn, that several other people had stopped where
we had, and were sleeping. Two of their horses had
got loose from their tether ropes, and were reared
upright striking at one another.</p>

<p>The Armenian and I were close under them, and
he was still sound asleep.</p>

<p>I woke him, and we sprang up. A little way off
was the soldier holding our horses. We mounted,
while the others tried to separate the screaming and
fighting stallions by shouting and throwing sticks and
stones at them.</p>

<p>It was four o’clock, and we heard the larks singing
overhead. Along the road an incessant stream
of baggage-horses was passing, trampling and
neighing. We had come a great deal more than
half-way, for we did not have far to go before we
reached the camp. After half an hour or so my
tent and baggage turned up.</p>

<p>It was Gur-i-Mar where we camped: we had
travelled slowly in the darkness. The Amîr, riding
on horseback, arrived with his guard soon after dawn,
but it was hours before the stream of pack-horses and
camels and elephants had come in.</p>

<p>I had breakfast as soon as the tent was up: cold
mutton, biscuit, and tea, and then lay on the ground
with a pillow, and went to sleep again. The fever
had disappeared. Towards midday it grew frightfully
hot, but I did not suffer so much, for my tent was put
up in the early morning over cool ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon the hot winds blew again, and
we had a violent dust storm. We did not have the
difficulty in procuring food that we had had the day
before, and I received also a fair supply of ice.</p>

<p>While the hot winds blew, the rim of the glass
I drank out of, though containing iced water, was
quite hot to the lips. I slept a good deal during
the day. At one in the morning I was called, and
I dressed by the light of a candle. When I got outside
I found the men were loading up. We started
about three a.m. His Highness, I found, had gone
on. It was excessively dark, and the Armenian and
I got off the road and lost our way on the plains.
We rode on trusting to our horses, but they were as
much at fault as we. We wandered about, down in
hollows and up on ridges, for the plain here was
undulating, like downs. We were in the neighbourhood
of the Abadu Pass&mdash;the valley of death.</p>

<p>It seemed to me we were getting too far to the left,
so we branched to the right. Towards dawn it became
very windy and dusty. At four o’clock it became lighter
and lighter, and the larks began to sing, and after
some trouble we found our way back to the road. To
my great relief the sky was cloudy, and the morning
comparatively cool. I had tucked a biscuit in the
top of my boot, and I munched it with great satisfaction:
the Armenian nearly went to sleep on
horseback. We camped at Naibabad. Soon after
the tents were up it began to rain: it was delicious
to hear the water come pattering down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr Lost on the Plains.</div>

<p>I found we were not the only ones who had lost
their way. At dawn the Amîr himself, with his
guard, was found wandering off towards Russia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>That day my demoniacal black pony untied his
ropes with his fore foot and teeth, and walked off.
He was not found till late in the afternoon, when he
was brought in looking a miserable wreck.</p>

<p>The fourth day was windy and comparatively
cool. We started at five a.m. His Highness rode
in a palanquin at the head of the army, and I rode
level some distance to the right. The mountains lay
to the right of us, the south, for we were nearing
Tash Kurghàn: to the north was the plain, and the
dust was frightful. We arrived at Tash Kurghàn at
eight. We went very short stages, for when I
had come to Mazar with Jan Mahomed Khan, we
did the journey from Tash Kurghàn to Mazar in
the day.</p>

<p>I sat in the tent of one of the Chamberlains, and
the Page boys came and chatted and drank tea with
me. They none of them seemed any the worse for the
journey. At eleven o’clock I went to my own tent,
which was erected on a mound outside the town, near
the tent of the British Agent. A good many sick
people were brought: some with fever and other
illnesses, another with snake bite. The snake had
bitten two men, the first one died, but the other
recovered. There were a good many surgical cases,
too, chiefly from horse kicks: broken legs, internal
injuries, and crushed fingers were the commonest. I
turned in at eight p.m.</p>

<p>We stayed the whole of the next day at Tash
Kurghàn. I was awakened at six in the morning by
the bugles, and after breakfast, finding I had a good
view of the Khulm Pass, I made a careful sketch. One
or two people called upon me, and then, after dressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
suitably, I mounted the little bay horse the Amîr had
sent me, and rode off to salaam His Highness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Durbar: The Amîr’s Health.</div>

<p>The town seemed very lively and full, compared
with what it did when I first came through
with Jan Mahomed. Gay-coated Courtiers and Page
boys were riding about, and soldiers were marching
here and there. The townspeople sat on their
walls and stood on their housetops to see the sights.</p>

<p>His Highness was occupying a large house in the
town. He was very gracious when I made my bow,
but did not look at all well.</p>

<p>While I was there, the chief townsmen brought
presents to His Highness. There was a good deal of
talking, to which I did not pay much attention, till I
noticed that His Highness became angry. Presently,
the men who had brought presents were taken outside
and thrashed severely. I was somewhat astonished,
and possibly looked so, for His Highness turned to
me and explained why he had ordered the men to be
thrashed. A report had reached him, which he found
on enquiry to be true, that these men had extorted
gifts from those poorer than themselves, and had
laid them before him as their own.</p>

<p>After lunch I asked His Highness if he were feeling
quite well. He said no: the sudden alteration
in his habits, and the heat of the journey, had upset
him. He seemed pleased that I had asked.</p>

<p>I left the Durbar soon after lunch to see a man
who had been seriously injured on the march. He
had a broken leg: a frightful smash it was: compound
and comminuted. While I was on the way
there, at three p.m., I noticed an extraordinary
darkness or twilight coming over everything. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
horses and other animals seemed frightened, and
made curious noises. I glanced up and found we had
a total eclipse of the sun. This was on June 17th,
1890. Everyone was very alarmed, imagining that
the eclipse betokened some serious calamity, either to
the King or the Country.</p>

<p>I was up at four the next morning, for the Armenian
wanted my breakfast over, so that the tent
could be packed as soon as possible. I had some
cold meat and bread, which my cook had wrapped
in a piece of paper overnight&mdash;this kept it from
becoming disagreeably dry. Plates, knives, and forks
were packed, and, in lieu thereof, I used my pocket-knife
and fingers. The baggage was loaded up while
I breakfasted: my tent being left till last.</p>

<p>His Highness started at five, and we an hour afterwards.
I had no adventures this day worth recounting.
We were among the mountains again: winding-paths,
ravines and bridges being the predominant features.
There were so many thousands on the march together
that divers discomforts arose. First, the dust was
choking, making the eyes and throat smart. Then
“blocks” occurred, and we got jammed in some of
the passes. Under these circumstances the horses at
once begin kicking and fighting, and you have to look
out for your shins. I had to stop by the wayside
frequently to bandage up some unfortunate who had
become damaged. I carried bandages and one or two
splints with me.</p>

<p>We got into a series of valleys, and in one, which
was regularly cup-shaped, with precipitous mountains
around it, we were jammed for about an hour. It
was quite an experience sitting in the dust and heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
among the kicking horses. However, there is an
end to most things if you wait long enough, and we got
out of the valley eventually. At ten a.m. we arrived
at the valley of Ghuzniguk, where Ishak fought against
the Amîr’s soldiers. His Highness himself, I heard,
was not present at the battle: his illness prevented
him leaving Kabul. Here we camped.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Afghan “Good Samaritan.”</div>

<p>When I rode into the town I saw the tent of my
neighbour, the Mirza Abdur Rashid, already erected,
and as my baggage had not yet arrived I dismounted
and entered it. It was empty, and I lay on the carpet
to rest. A soldier, whom I did not recognize, brought
me a pillow, some iced water, and a piece of bread.
I thanked him, and when I had eaten and drank I lay
down again: he stood and fanned me, whereat I was
thankful, till finally I fell asleep. I woke by-and-bye
and found the kindly Afghan had departed. I was
sitting cross-legged, leaning against the pillow, with
a look of pensive melancholy on, when the Mirza and
some others entered. After shaking hands we sat
down again, and the Mirza said,</p>

<p>“Doctor Sahib bisyar manda shud.” “The
Doctor Sahib is very tired.”</p>

<p>I could not admit this before the others, and I
broke out into Persian: “Né manda na shudam&mdash;gurisna
shudam.” “Nay, I am not tired, I am hungry.”</p>

<p>In those days I so rarely would attempt to talk
Persian that they laughed; and I had used the
colloquial Afghan-Persian <i>gurisna</i> instead of the
correct <i>gursina</i>. A tray of cold meat cut up into
cubes, and some bread, was brought, and we helped
ourselves with our fingers.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Armenian sent word that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
tent was up, and I went off there and slept again for
a couple of hours. After that the Armenian suggested
my using his tent one day and my own the next, so
that a tent could be sent on beforehand and made
ready by the time I arrived. Dinner came, as usual,
from His Highness’s cook, and I turned in at eight.
The Armenian and the servants slept on the ground
outside the tent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Poisonous Sting.</div>

<p>The next morning, June 19th, I turned out at three,
and had breakfast at four o’clock: it was dawn. Soon
after, I was sent for to see a man who had been stung
in the night by something or other. What it was I
couldn’t quite make out, for the Armenian’s knowledge
of English names was limited. He described
a creature with many legs attached to a central body.
I suggested a “crab.” He said he thought that might
be it; on consideration I thought it hardly likely:
and centipede and poisonous spider occurred to me.
Whatever it were, the patient was in a state of
“collapse.” Perspiration stood on his face, he had
a weak slow pulse, headache, and burning pains in the
limbs. I was about to give medicine and port wine
when His Highness came riding by on a trotting
camel, followed by his guard on horseback. Seeing
a group around a man on the ground, and me in the
middle of it, he stopped to enquire what was the
matter. They carried the man to him and explained.
The Amîr asked a few questions about the symptoms:
whether the man’s eyeballs ached, and whether he
sweated. When he heard that the skin was acting
he turned to me and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Inshallah, jour méshowad.” “If God will, he
will become well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>He told me he had a native medicine, an excellent
remedy for poisonous stings: this he was about to
administer: if it were not effectual he would wish
me to give European medicine. He gave an order in
Persian to one of the attendants, who presently
brought him a little inlaid box. His Highness
unbuttoned his coat and took a small key which was
hanging by a chain round his neck. He opened the
box and took out a little egg-shaped casket of gold,
and from that a stone. He directed a little of the
stone to be scraped off, mixed with water, and laid
on the wound. This stone, I was informed, was from
the gall bladder of an antelope. Then he rode on,
and by-and-bye I followed. The man was to stop
at Ghuzniguk that day and be brought on in the
evening. I left two or three doses of medicine and
some wine, in case they were needed.</p>

<p>That day’s march was pleasant: being among fields
of clover and corn, it was refreshing to the eye, and
there was very little dust. We camped at eight a.m.
There was a cool breeze blowing all day, and I lay
in my tent reading Shakespeare and drinking iced-water.
The night was cool, and to me it felt almost
cold. At midnight, I was called up to see the
man who had been stung: they had brought him
on. He was certainly better, but had retention, and
I passed an instrument. The men looking after him
had thought they would be on the safe side, and
they gave him all the medicine and wine I had left,
in addition to applying His Highness’s remedy.</p>

<p>I went to bed again for two or three hours, and
then got up and had breakfast. We started at five.
Hitherto, I had been riding the black pony, “Steam-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>engine,”
but this day, as I heard the road was good,
and through valleys, I rode the young bay horse His
Highness had given me. I found the road was not all
valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangers of By-paths.</div>

<div>We reached a ravine where the road branched
into two. One branch ran to the left of the ravine,
the other wound up the face of the mountain to the
right. When the Armenian and I arrived at the
division, we found there was a block on the left
road, and, therefore, took the one on the right.
We had got some distance up when a block occurred
here also. The Armenian, who was leading, at once
took a little by-path which ran along the edge, a
little below the main road, and I followed. I did
not like it. Looking directly down I could see the
bottom of the ravine, and on the other side, down
below, I could see the other road crowded with
cavalry and baggage-horses, indiscriminately mixed.
Imagine yourself riding along the sill of your bedroom
window on a young untried horse, and you
will get an idea of what I am trying to explain.
<div class="figright">
<img src="images/zillt338.png" alt="" />
</div>
The path was barely three
feet wide. The situation in
itself was unpleasant, and I
did not know how my horse
would behave in mountain
climbing. Some young horses
are frightened, and instead
of keeping their attention
fixed on what is before them,
they look about&mdash;mine did, and neighed when he
saw the horses below&mdash;slip, become frightened, plunge
and slip more: then&mdash;various complications arise.</div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, I saw the Armenian pause a second&mdash;he
was riding a steady old mountain pony&mdash;glance
up to the road above and put his horse straight up
the slope. There was a scramble, a scatter of sparks,
as the hoofs struck the rock, and he was up on
the road. I saw why, when he was gone, and my
turn came. The path ended: rounding off into
nothing. There was no room to turn back, nor to
dismount; I could not stay where I was, and I put
him at rocky slope. The horse looked up: a little
touch of the spur, and I grasped his mane with
both hands: he reared straight up, gave a spring
from his hind legs, and in a moment was on
the slope. I lived a long time in the next few
seconds, for it flashed into me that, if we ever got
up, the crush on the road above would leave no
room for us, and we must inevitably slip back.
But, no! he scrambled like a cat, and darting into a
gap in the stream of baggage-horses, we were safe
on the path. I hoped I didn’t look very sickly: I
felt so. Presently, we were able to escape from the
stream of traffic by riding along a narrow ridge,
then we descended a horribly steep slope. This,
however, was earthy and stony, not bare rock, and
it afforded a firmer foothold: the bay went down
sideways, like a crab. In the place where we
scrambled up, the rock was rough and somewhat
irregular. If it had been smooth, this probably
would never have been written.</p>

<p>Then we got on to a wide road in a valley;
presently there was another block, and the Armenian
turned off the road to the right. I shouted angrily,</p>

<p>“Look here! I am not going along any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
of your infernal paths. I would rather sit in a block
for an hour: we are not in such a tremendous hurry.”</p>

<p>He called back, “Sir! he is all right here.”</p>

<p>The ground was broken-up by huge cracks, seven
or eight yards wide! A man rode out from the
crush and looked, then turned his horse back and
re-entered the crowded road. Away across the
broken-up plain we could see a road running along
the foot of a mountain. It was not very crowded,
and, after all, we were not on a mountain with only
bare rock under foot, so we went for it. Scrambling
down the cracks or miniature ravines, some fourteen
or fifteen feet deep, we waded, or rather rode,
through pools of water, and scrambled up the other
side. I don’t know how many we climbed into and
out of&mdash;but a good many. The Armenian’s horse,
though a good mountain-climber, was afraid of water,
and he refused and shied, but had to go. When he
was plunging the Armenian’s turban tumbled off into
a pool, but he fished it out and clapped it on his
head again, wet, and cursed his horse in Persian.</p>

<p>At last we got on to the road at the foot of the
mountain, and went some distance; but it became
excessively stony and rough.</p>

<p>The Armenian said, “He is become worse, you
go further.”</p>

<p>We, therefore, branched off to the left from the
road, and found ourselves in a marshy valley. In
the mountains, on the left, I saw the openings of
several caves, and there were waterfalls tumbling
down the rocks. This valley was infested with
tigers, but there were too many people about, and
too much noise for that to be a danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Cheap Drink.</div>

<p>Then we got among cornfields again. Where all
the other roads led to I don’t know, but we found
a great many people riding along here, though we
were not badly crowded. I came alongside of the
Page boy who used to live next door to me in
Mazar, but we lost him again in the crowd. We
went on and on through villages, where trees and
vegetables were growing&mdash;a refreshing sight after
a life in Mazar. Further on, the roads apparently
converged, for the lanes became more and more
crowded and more and more dusty, till I was compelled
to tie a handkerchief over my nose and mouth.
In one valley seeing a few cows and goats feeding near
some huts, we branched off to try and get a drink:
the peasants brought some milk in a wooden vessel
which the Armenian poured into my cup and handed to
me. He preferred drinking whey, of which the peasants
had a plentiful supply, for it is a popular drink, but
advised me not to drink any as it is apt to disagree.
We had as much milk and whey as we wanted for
two pice, that is a little more than a farthing.</p>

<p>Finally, we neared the suburbs of the town of
Haibuk. The crush became greater and the dust
awful. Everyone’s hair, beard, eyebrows, and eyelashes
were white. Those who had started as youths
in the morning looked grey-haired men, and were
hardly recognizable.</p>

<p>The people of the town turned out, and regardless
of the dust and the heat of the sun&mdash;they were
used to it, I suppose&mdash;sat on their garden walls to
look at us.</p>

<p>I had another scare: it was in the town. As
we were going along we saw an elephant in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of us. Horses are generally frightened at elephants,
but mine went quietly enough, so long as the elephant
was going away from him, and he could see him;
but just before we reached the river we passed him.
The river is not very wide, perhaps fifteen feet, but
it has very steep rocky banks. There was a narrow
bridge across, and the Armenian being ahead of me,
leading the way, got across at once. Before I
reached the bank, a man sitting between the packs
of a baggage-horse, got on the bridge and went
slowly. My horse having the elephant behind him
plunged furiously, and as the elephant advanced,
kept shying round, sidling nearer and nearer to the
edge of the bank. I could not get on to the bridge,
because the fool on his pack-horse blocked it. The
Armenian and others, seeing the danger I was in,
shouted at the man; he did not hurry: I doubt if
he understood. When we had got to the very edge
of the bank&mdash;only just in time, the bridge was clear,
and my horse darted across. The bridge was a
narrow affair, about four feet wide, made of trunks
of trees and cross-bars, with earth levelled on the
top. I could not take my horse on till it was clear,
for I knew he would charge the pack-horse, and
the <em>best</em> I could hope for then would be a leg
broken against one of the mule trunks. I am a
mild man, as I said before, but if I had happened
to have had a hunting crop in my hand, I
would have woke up that somnolent Afghan. The
whole business did not occupy a minute, not half
a minute; but when a horse is frightened, I need
scarcely say he does not look where he is going.</p>

<p>Riding through the town we came to an embank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>ment
covered with grass, an aqueduct, along the top
of which ran a stream of very clear water. I dismounted,
and sat under the shade of the trees by
the stream and washed the dust off my head and
hands. It was delightfully cool and breezy, and there
was an excellent view of the fort, a part of the town,
the mountains, and the river down below.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Camp in an Orchard.</div>

<p>The Armenian went on with the servants to find
the place where the “Quartermaster” had given
orders for my tent to be pitched. As I sat alone by
the stream several people, whom I knew, went by and
saluted. After about an hour, one of the servants
came back to conduct me to the tent. We descended
the embankment, and rode down a lane leading to the
river. My tent was in an orchard on the other side.
The river was rather wide but shallow, and we
forded it on our horses. We got into the orchard by
scrambling through a gap in the wall.</p>

<p>I found there were other tents besides mine in the
orchard, and some horses were endeavouring to graze.
The Armenian ordered the horses out and the other
tents to be moved further away.</p>

<p>My tent was put up on a mound about six feet
high, and I went in and sat on the carpet. It was
stifling after the breezy hill. The trees and high
walls of the orchard kept off the breeze without
sheltering my tent from the sun. There was no view,
except of dusty leaves and brown earth&mdash;the grass
was withered. I was tired, thirsty, and hungry; there
was nothing to drink or eat, and I had no tobacco.
I growled at everybody who came within reach; and
the ants crawled down my neck and up my sleeve,
and black grasshoppers jumped in my face and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
up my back. As soon as the cook arrived, which was
some time afterwards, he hurried off to the bazaar.
He came back in about half an hour with two teapots
full of tea: I gulped down ten or eleven cupfuls, and
then made an enjoyable meal off some cold mutton
that the cook fished out of the baggage; after that I
unearthed a cigar from one of the trunks, and felt
more at peace with the world; for the crawling creatures
did not sting, though they were disagreeable.</p>

<p>These are the ordinary everyday incidents
of a march. As a rule one does not find the
opportunity to write them down, and they are
forgotten the next day. I, however, happened to
write a letter home that evening and I have just
copied it.</p>

<p>There was no meat to be obtained in the bazaar,
and I gave the Armenian four shillings to buy a
sheep; for although my meals came from His
Highness’s kitchen, those of the servants and the
Armenian did not.</p>

<p>We remained in Haibuk for nearly a fortnight, the
army being camped on the mountain. I sat all day in
the stifling tent drinking iced water and reading
Shakespeare. At intervals during the day, sick and
injured people were brought and I attended to them.
But those wretched “microbes” that I had swallowed
in my fever on the plains began to work their wicked
will on me, and I became ill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Durbar in Haibuk.</div>

<p>Four days after we arrived His Highness held a
Durbar. After I had seen my patients I mounted
the bay and rode through the town to where His
Highness was sitting. This was in a rather large
garden attached to a house. There were some big
trees and a good many flowers in the garden. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
the latter, I remember noticing the “Fleur de Lys,”
or French lily. A pond or tank, supplied by an irrigation
channel, was in the garden, and near it sat
His Highness on a couch covered with silk and cloth
of gold. The couch was shaded by a large red and
white awning. The Courtiers and Pages stood near,
and all around were cornfields. I had taken with me
a catalogue of revolvers from a London firm (Colt’s)
that His Highness had asked me, with the help of the
Armenian, to translate. When he had examined the
translation he spoke of the city of Haibuk, and explained
how he intended to fortify it, and how the
water supply would be ensured. He told me there
was a remarkable ancient monument near Haibuk,
and some ancient caves of considerable interest. He
advised my riding out to see them, as they were not
very far from the town. Lunch was brought, and
afterwards His Highness gave me a plateful of nectarines
as big as peaches.</p>

<p>I rode out the next day with the Armenian and
some others, to see the ancient monument.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rustom’s Throne.</div>

<p>I found that a small rocky hill, or spur, at the
foot of the mountains, had been rounded at the apex
into a cupola: the rock all around it being cut
away as a sort of trench, or moat, some twenty feet
deep and eight or nine feet across. On the top of
the rounded cupola was, apparently, a tiny temple,
flat-topped, with a doorway on one side flanked by
pillars, which, to the best of my recollection, were
Greek in style. We got across the trench, or moat,
and were able to examine the structure on the top.
Apparently, it was cut out of the rock. The doorway
was cut inwards for about two feet, and ended in flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
rock. Writing from recollection&mdash;it was in 1890 I
saw it&mdash;I should say the “temple” was about seven
feet high and five or six feet square at the base.
The rounded cupola was, perhaps, thirty feet across.
This they told me was called “Rustom’s Throne.”</p>

<p>We then went to see the caves, which were near.
They opened on the face of the mountain. The
largest&mdash;used then as a storehouse for grain&mdash;had
an entrance level with the ground, and a larger
opening some twenty feet higher up. It was, therefore,
perfectly light inside. The roof was domed
and ornamented in the middle with a huge sunflower,
treated decoratively. The same style of decoration
was repeated on the walls. The other caves were
smaller and dark.</p>

<p>I made sketches of the caves, and of Rustom’s
Throne.</p>

<p>The next morning His Highness sent for me to
see the Governor of Haibuk, who had been wounded
some time before by a bullet through the roof of his
mouth and upper jaw. After the removal of pieces of
necrosed bone, I suggested that a gold plate should
be fitted into the roof of the mouth. His Highness
said there was a man in Kabul who had been
taught by an English dentist, Mr. O’Meara, how
to take the model of the mouth in wax: he could
make a suitable plate, and, if necessary, fix on
artificial teeth. I was about to retire then, but His
Highness invited me to stay and drink tea, and a
chair was placed for me near him. He said he should
much like to see my sketch-book, as he had heard I
had made a drawing of Rustom’s Throne. The
Armenian at once galloped off to my tent to fetch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
it. His Highness was much amused at some of the
sketches, particularly of one of the Armenian where
he lay on the ground in front of the fire&mdash;I had
drawn it one evening in Mazar. He said he looked
as though he were&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;suffering from
alcoholic intoxication.</p>

<p>As the Armenian was a Christian, and therefore
not forbidden to drink alcohol, this mild joke amused
everybody except the Armenian, and the more ashamed
and angry he looked, the more they laughed. Of the
other sketches His Highness recognized whom they
were meant for: but those of Rustom’s Throne, the
caves, and the sketch of the Khulm Pass, His
Highness admired so exceedingly, that I had to cut
them out of the book at once and give them to him.
That is the reason I have to describe Rustom’s Throne
from memory.</p>

<p>His Highness then showed me a block of very
beautiful clear ice, which he said had been obtained
from a cavern near Haibuk. He asked me to take the
block away and test its purity.</p>

<p>There was another Durbar on July 1st, and by
this time the “microbes” had got firm hold of me.
I went to the Durbar. His Highness had heard
that I was ill, and I told him I had not with me the
medicine I wished to take. His Highness asked,
Would I take native medicine if he prescribed it?
I said I should be most grateful to His Highness if he
would honour me so far. His Highness gave some
directions to a Hakim, who presently brought a small
jar. The Amîr told me it contained a medicine he was
himself taking. With a little silver spoon he took some
dark-looking confection out of the jar, made a bolus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
of it, and gave it to me. It tasted hot and very nice.
There was no more in the pot, and he sent the
Hakim away to make some fresh. It was then that
my mind became troubled within me, for I knew the
Hakim loved me not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Courtesy.</div>

<p>Presently the jar was brought back, and as they
were about to give it me, His Highness asked for it.
He scooped a little out with the spoon, and was
raising it to his lips, when the Hakim stopped him
and whispered in his ear. The Amîr turned and
looked at him, and the Hakim hurried away with a
very red face. By-and-bye he returned with the jar.
Again the Amîr took it, and, looking at me, he raised
a spoonful to his lips and swallowed it. He then gave
the jar into the hands of the Armenian, who immediately
brought it to me.</p>

<p>One need not live in the East to understand the
courtesy and kindness of the Amîr’s action; but to
appreciate fully the honour he did me, one must be
conversant with Oriental customs. To taste a medicine
before handing it to the patient is the duty of an
Oriental physician when he is attending the King. I
was a servant&mdash;but also a stranger and a guest&mdash;and
the Amîr treated me as though I had been a Prince.</p>

<p>I cannot say whether the medicine would have
cured me or not, for in two days’ time we had to be on
the march again: which was bad for me.</p>

<p>Then came a time, the details of which I do
not care to recall too vividly to my mind, for the
“microbes” were just as venomous and wicked as if
they had been Hindustani Interpreters at the Afghan
Court, and that is saying much.</p>

<p>Instead of being in bed, I had to jog along on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
horseback half the day. Instead of a sick man’s diet,
I got a little cold meat and bread when and how I
could; sometimes after a fast of ten or eleven
hours. Under these circumstances, of what use could
the Amîr’s or anyone else’s medicine be?</p>

<p>The first day’s march was very beautiful: by the
banks of a river which ran through cultivated valleys
and ravines: and here and there were cascades.
At the end of the march I was faint, and the
Armenian rushed off to the medical stores for some
brandy. He then sent a report in to the Amîr, and the
next day His Highness kindly sent me his Shikari
elephant. Riding the elephant was much easier
work than horse riding: I could take a supply of
suitable food, and I picked up again. We started at
four in the morning, before the others: for an
elephant goes slowly, and cavalry and baggage-horses
shy, and then on the mountains, or in a
crowd, accidents happen.</p>

<p>I was rocked along through gorges and valleys
and villages. In a village, if a wall were in the way,
the elephant kicked it over with his foot, and walked
across the garden or orchard, as the case might be.
We started at two the next morning, for the road was
hilly. The cavalry horses were still tethered in line,
and, as we passed them, they struggled and pulled
against the foot-ropes to escape the awful creature.
It was moonlight, and the deep shadows and gleaming
rocks and peaks were the reality of Doré’s fantastic
ideas. When we camped, patients were brought to
me from the villages as well as from the army: one
peasant who had brought a sick child presented me
with a lamb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>The day after&mdash;Sunday&mdash;we had to make a long
detour to avoid a gorge that was too narrow for the
elephant to get through.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I turned out at half-past four.
It felt bitterly cold, and I put on an ulster. We
waited awhile, but no elephant turned up. Some said
he was ill with fever; others said the Sultana had
sent for him. They therefore saddled the black pony
and I mounted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dangerous Passes.</div>

<p>We had such awful mountain passes to traverse
that the camels and pack-horses were compelled to
go another and much longer road. One path I
remember on the side of a mountain: it was about
five feet wide: in one place it had crumbled
away, and was hardly two feet wide, with a precipice
going sheer down. The path went steeply up
and steeply down, and was covered with little loose
stones. It was no good trying to ride it, for on
account of the loose pebbles, a horse could not climb
it with a man on his back. I got off, put the bridle
over my arm, and, scotching my feet on firmer pieces
of rock, managed to get up, the horse scrambling
after me. Though I was ill and weak, I could not
help a burst of laughter at the Armenian as he
crawled up on all fours.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, at ten a.m., we reached Kamard or
Shush-Bûrjah, and my tent was put up in an
orchard. I lay under a walnut-tree all day and
saw patients. We stayed here three days, and His
Highness held a Durbar. I went, and His Highness
told me about the source of a river there: how it
came from a tunnel at the foot of the mountain, and
the water was hot; and how it rendered the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
warm in the winter. I had lunch with His Highness,
and then went to attend to a man with a broken
thigh.</p>

<p>On the Friday, we started again and crossed
that awful mountain, the “Tooth-breaker,” Dandan
Shikan. I found that the road had been greatly
improved since I was last there. As it was, however,
there were a great many accidents. We went
on to Saighan, and they brought one old fellow
of seventy to me, the uncle of the Chief Secretary,
or Dabier-ul-Mulk. His horse had slipped sideways
on Dandan Shikan, and he had broken his right arm
just below the shoulder and his right thigh just
above the knee. I put him up in splints, and he
was carried the rest of the journey in a sort of
cradle slung on a camel; another injured man being
on the other side. The old man quite recovered.</p>

<p>We camped one day at Akrab-abad, and though it
was the middle of July, the night was excessively cold.
The winter there is bitter, hence the name&mdash;Akrab
meaning a scorpion. It is about ten thousand feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>We reached the western extremity of the
Bamian Valley, and His Highness’s chief cook had
a row with mine. Between the two I received some
beef-tea that was sour. The Hakim Abdur Rashid,
having been sent by His Highness to enquire how
I was, the Armenian, with much vigour and energy,
detailed the iniquities of the cooks. The matter
was reported to His Highness: he sent for the cooks
and informed them that if I did not recover he
would blow them to pieces from the cannon’s mouth.
My cook bolted before we reached Kabul. I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
his “prognosis” of the case was unsatisfactory.
I don’t know where he went to, and I did not see
him again till I was better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Camp of the Camels.</div>

<p>We rode through the Bamian Valley and passed
the colossal Figures, the Caves, the ancient Cities,
and the modern fortified Villages. It was very
beautiful, and I really fancied I was better. There
were cornfields, beanfields, grass, trees, and river.</p>

<p>The soldiers camped at the end of the valley,
beyond Zohak-i-Marhan, where it is narrow. There
were some camels camped here also, and their weird
moans and bubbling cries echoing back from the
rocks were horrible to hear. They sounded like the
hopeless cries of the damned: at least, I thought
so&mdash;I was evidently morbid.</p>

<p>Here a soldier of the Amîr’s bodyguard quarrelled
with a comrade and killed him. I don’t know if he
were hanged.</p>

<p>I saw a little brown spaniel leading a camel
along by a rope. I really do not know whether a
dog is “unclean” or not, but the Afghans occasionally,
though rarely, make pets of them. They
more often make pets of partridges&mdash;a speckled
bird, with a curious rippling cry&mdash;and train them
to fight. I have often seen a bird trotting along
after his master: it looks very odd.</p>

<p>We went through the ravine where the water
dashes down and enters a tunnel in the rock.
Further on, a camel in the crush was pushed over
the edge and fell with his load down the ravine.
Its young one sprang after it. The Amîr passing
some time afterwards with his guard, halted to look
at the place. The horse of one of the guard was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
frightened, and backed away from the precipice:
the man, incensed, cut it violently with the cruel
doubled-lashed Afghan whip; the horse gave a
bound forward, and he and his rider disappeared over
the edge.</p>

<p>From here the road led over high mountains,
and it was very cold and rainy. I had to have
occasional doses of brandy from the medical stores
in order to keep going, and at one place His
Highness, when he arrived, was kind enough to stop
at my tent to enquire how I was. The next day,
he sent his palanquin to me, and I was borne along
on the shoulders of four sturdy Afghans. I was
not a heavy burden, unfortunately, and they hurried
along up hill and down dale, over rocks and through
defiles at a pace that was to me, in my feebleness,
terrifying.</p>

<p>We camped at Gardandiwal. This was the occasion
I referred to some way back, on which I gave a
banquet to a dozen men&mdash;the relays of palanquin
bearers&mdash;which cost me rather less than sixpence a
head. I ought to say that the men refused at first,
lest the fact might reach His Highness’s ears and
displease him.</p>

<p>Here His Highness sent me some specimens to test
for coal. I am not a geologist, but, as far as I could
judge, from my rough tests, there was, in the specimens
he sent me, some coal and a good deal of stone.</p>

<p>After this I became very ill, and His Highness
sent several times to enquire how I was. One day he
sent for the Armenian and gave him directions as to
the diet I should have. He hoped I should be better
on the third day from then, as he wished me to ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
into Kabul with him. He said that brandy was not
good for me, as it tended to produce congestion of the
liver.</p>

<p>The next day we arrived at Kalai Kasi, within a
few miles of Kabul, and Mr. Pyne and the two other
English engineers rode out from Kabul to welcome
His Highness. Afterwards they came to my tent.
I was very pleased to see them. They were the first
English I had seen since Captain Griesbach left
Mazar, more than a year before. They were very jolly,
but their vigorous energy was, to a poor debilitated
mortal, rather overpowering. I remember Pyne
enquired why I sat on the ground: I explained that
I had no chair, it was broken. He also asked why
I did not have my hair cut: I told him there was no
barber, and that we had been on the march a month
and a half. After dinner they rode back with a
guard to Kabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kindness of the Amîr.</div>

<p>Early the next morning His Highness held a
Durbar, and at five o’clock I girded up my loins,
mounted a horse, and rode to His Highness’s quarters.
Outside the khirgar, or wigwam, where His Highness
slept, there was erected a large red and white awning.
Under this, in the shade, were several chairs and
two or three portable tables covered with fruit and
flowers. Several people, Officers and Courtiers, were
sitting there, and I joined them. Soon, we heard
that His Highness had risen, and I was sent for
into the khirgar. His Highness was sitting on the
couch, and on a little table by him were some
biscuits and fruit, and a cup of tea. He enquired
very kindly after my health, suggesting various remedies,
and gave me advice as regards diet. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
not hear of my riding on horseback into Kabul, but
said I must be carried in the palanquin. He said
many kind things, and finally gave me “Rûkhsat,”
or permission to depart, for I was feeble. I returned
to the tent till we were ready to start.</p>

<p>The lanes, cornfields, fruit trees, and general
freshness and greenness of the suburbs of Kabul
reminded me of England, and were most grateful to
the eye after the dusty barrenness of Mazar.</p>

<p>Presently we turned off from the Kabul road; and
some way off I saw a hill with crowds of people on it.
There were rows of spectators on each side of the
road leading to it. Evidently the grand reception was
not to be in the town. I had hoped to get away somewhere
and rest.</p>

<p>I became conscious that I was not shaven, and
that my collar was an old one and frayed. I had
one, among my much-tattered linen&mdash;the Afghan
washermen dash your linen on a stone to wash it, and
starch it with flour&mdash;I had one, carefully saved for
this very event, but, alas! it was in a portmanteau!</p>

<p>The Armenian said, “Sir, you not care it.
Highness know you ill. Other men, who is!”</p>

<p>There was no help for it, and we reached the top
of the hill. Here, under a large awning, was a circle
of Orientals, in their robes and turbans, seated on
the ground. They were the Maleks and Chiefs from
the Kabul province. At one side of the circle seated
on chairs were His Highness’s two eldest sons, the
Princes Habibullah and Nasrullah. I got out of the
palanquin and walked feebly into the middle of the
circle and bowed to the Princes.</p>

<p>They enquired politely after my health, and Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Habibullah, turning to the Armenian, said in Persian,
“He looks very ill, what is the matter?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “High Garden.”</div>

<p>Then he gave orders for me to be taken to the
“Baghi Buland,” or “High Garden,” on a hill close
by. Accordingly I was carried there. This was
where the reception of His Highness was to take
place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reception.</div>

<p>There was a temporary pavilion erected, gaily
adorned with hangings of crimson and white, and
with large bouquets of flowers. It was furnished
with carpets, couches, tables, and chairs. There was
a part raised some three steps, which commanded a
view from the window of a little artificial waterfall,
a fountain, trees, and the lovely Baghi Shah Valley.
This valley lies outside Kabul, just north of the
Chahar Bagh Valley, and separated from it by the
Asmai Mountains.</p>

<p>A few people were collected in the Pavilion, and
the Armenian brought a chair for me. I knew no
one, and felt rather out of it. Presently Malek, the
Amîr’s favourite Page, entered, and everyone stood
to receive him. He took no notice of anyone, but
rushed up to me and enquired how I was. At once
the manner of those in the Pavilion altered. When
a European in Kabul has become of interest to the
Amîr, every one bows the knee&mdash;metaphorically
speaking&mdash;and he has a good time. But once let
His Highness’s interest wane, and, as it struck me
then, the said European would be likely to have a
very middling time.</p>

<p>A crowd began to collect on the Baghi Buland
Hill, some entering the Pavilion.</p>

<p>By-and-bye there was a rattle of kettledrums, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
confused murmur of many voices&mdash;but no cheering
as in England&mdash;and the Amîr approached, riding on
horseback. There was a great deal of bustle, and
suddenly the two Princes appeared just outside the
Pavilion. The Amîr, having reached the top of
the hill, dismounted: the crowd opened, and the
two Princes advancing, knelt and kissed His Highness’s
feet. He raised each one and kissed him on
the forehead. The Amîr then entered the Pavilion;
walking with a stick. I took off my solar helmet
and bowed with the rest, and His Highness went up
the steps to the raised part of the hall. The
Armenian whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Follow Highness.”</p>

<p>The Amîr took his seat upon a couch near a large
window: in front of him was a small table with some
lovely roses on it.</p>

<p>The Courtiers, the more important Chiefs and I,
were standing near. His Highness caught sight of
me almost directly, and most kindly ordered a chair
to be placed in a particular spot near the couch, to
the right, and a little behind where he sat.</p>

<p>Then a salute of several guns was fired: the vibration
of the air making the Pavilion shake, we
adjourned temporarily to another room.</p>

<p>On our return Mr. Pyne and the two other
Engineers arrived. Pyne looked very smart in a
European frock-coat, with a flower in his button-hole:
the two other Englishmen were neatly dressed
in corduroy riding-suits and long boots.</p>

<p>The Amîr shook hands with Mr. Pyne, spoke to
him for a few moments, and then chairs were placed
for them near mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>About midday I began to feel dreadfully tired,
and as some people had already taken their departure,
I turned round and asked Pyne if he cared to go
then.</p>

<p>He said that the Prince had given orders that we
were to wait till the roads were clear, and I waited
a little longer. Presently, as I began to feel giddy,
I said to the Armenian&mdash;</p>

<p>“I am going.”</p>

<p>He said: “Shahzada Sahib said, a little you stop
till&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Can’t help it,” I said.</p>

<p>I stood up, stepped to the Amîr’s couch and
bowed.</p>

<p>“Rûkhsat?” said His Highness. “Are you
going?”</p>

<p>“Bali, Sahib,” I said. “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>His Highness kindly said, “Bisyar-khôb. Ba
aman-i-Khuda.” “Very well. Good-bye.”</p>

<p>I bowed and retired.</p>

<p>Outside the Pavilion I got into the palanquin and
was carried to Pyne’s room at the workshops.</p>

<p>I found him there: he had left soon after I had,
and, galloping into Kabul by another road, had
arrived before me.</p>

<p>He said I looked ill at the Durbar, and he made
me drink a tumblerful of sparkling hock at once.
I stayed with him a fortnight, till my house was
ready. He was exceedingly hospitable, and with
well meant, but somewhat mistaken kindness, forced
upon me whisky, beer, hock, and all sorts of unsuitable
food. He tried to brighten me up by
taking me about the workshops and showing me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
what progress had been made since I had left
Kabul, and in the evening he told me yarns and
stories without number. Once or twice it was
almost too much, and I became giddy and faint. He
was very kind, but I was thankful when I got to
my house and could lie down.</p>

<p>With proper diet and medicine I began to improve,
but it was months before I quite recovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Îd” Salaam.</div>

<p>Four days after our arrival in Kabul, namely on
July 28th, the Mahomedan Festival of Îd commenced,
and His Highness held a Durbar in the “Salaam
Khana.” I went, accompanied by the Armenian. I
should have been better in bed. We waited in the
large hall, I talking to one of the Chief Secretaries.
Presently we heard the rattle of drums, indicating
that the Amîr had arrived. He did not, however,
come in, and I was wondering where he was, when a
Page came and spoke to the Armenian, and he and I
and the Secretary were conducted upstairs to the
Guest House that I have already described. His Highness,
seated in an arm-chair, was almost alone in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
room. After I had made my bow an arm-chair was
placed for me opposite the Amîr, so that he could speak
to me conveniently. His Highness had been talking
some little while when Mr. Pyne arrived; he continued
talking to us both for some time. He referred to the
work we both of us had done: said that it was a
means of educating his people; referred to my having
become ill in his service, and promised me some
months’ leave of absence that winter, in order that
I might recover my health in my own country.</p>

<p>Presently, lunch was served, and he ordered for
me broth thickened with rice&mdash;“Shola.”</p>

<p>Three days after this, the Amîr visited the workshops.
I did not join the party until the Amîr had
finished inspecting the machinery, but went to see
two or three people who were sick. When I returned
to the shops I found His Highness had finished
inspecting. He was seated in the grounds under the
shade of a huge mulberry tree. A table was placed
in front of him on which were fruit and sweetmeats.</p>

<p>There were seated at the table, on the Amîr’s
right, the two eldest Princes. Opposite His Highness
were Sirdar Usuf Khan, the Amîr’s uncle; Mr. Pyne;
and the Dabier-ul-mulk, or Chief Secretary. I bowed
to His Highness, and he ordered a chair to be placed
for me on his left. We ate some sweets and fruit,
and His Highness expressed his great satisfaction at
the progress that had been made in the workshops.
His saying of “My money, your work, and God’s
help will produce what I need” has become proverbial.</p>

<p>There were stationary engine, steam-hammer,
steam-saws, cartridge plant, a minting machine, and
a blast smelting furnace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>Big guns, machine guns, rifles, swords, leather
work, soap, candles, and coin, were made by the busy
hands of hundreds of men, Afghans and Hindustanis,
under the direction of Mr. Pyne and his assistants.
Since then more machinery has been added to the
shops, but they have been so recently described in
the public press that I need not go into further
detail.</p>

<p>When His Highness had finished speaking he
shook hands with Mr. Pyne, and acknowledging the
salutations of the others, he departed.</p>

<p>I heard that a soldier was detected slipping a
cartridge into his rifle just as His Highness entered
the shops, but that he was seized before he could do
any mischief, even if he desired.</p>

<p>Four days after the Royal visit to the workshops
His Highness became the guest of the two eldest
Princes at the Palace of Endekki. This is about
six miles out of Kabul, in the Chahardeh Valley.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lunch at Endekki.</div>

<p>About two o’clock in the afternoon came a letter
inviting the Englishmen, Mr. Pyne, myself, and one
of the two Engineers, to meet His Highness there. A
small brougham was sent for us. The roads about
Kabul are good, and His Highness and the Princes
have several carriages.</p>

<p>The Palace of Endekki is at the top of a small hill.
In the distance it has rather the appearance of a Greek
temple with pillars around it. After climbing the hill
one mounts a flight of stone steps to a terrace, from
the centre of which rises the main body of the Palace.
A few more steps, and one enters a lobby which
leads into the long hall. This has a row of pillars in
the centre supporting the roof, and is lit on each side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
by three large windows. It was furnished somewhat
elaborately in the European style; resembling very
much, though it was smaller than, the Salaam Khana,
or great Durbar Hall in Kabul.</p>

<p>Lunch was brought soon after our arrival, and we
three English sat at a table by ourselves, being waited
upon by the chief Hindustani cook.</p>

<p>After lunch His Highness invited us into a small
room opening into the long hall at the opposite end
from the lobby. This was a very pretty little room:
one side of it was bowed or rounded, and had
three large windows in it overlooking the valley.
The room was furnished like an English drawing-room,
even to the Collard and Collard piano. His
Highness asked if either of us could play, and
Mr. Pyne sat down and played some hymns. It
seemed very strange to hear “Abide with Me” in
Afghanistan, among Mussulmans. Shortly after this
Mr. Pyne felt rather faint and ill. There was no
whisky nor brandy to be had, and the Amîr suggested
champagne, but Mr. Pyne thought he would rather
go back to the shops. He therefore made his adieux
to the Amîr and the Princes; and the Armenian was
sent with him. To interpret for me was a Hindustani&mdash;a
man with more polish of manner than the
Armenian.</p>

<p>In the evening we accompanied His Highness and
the Princes into the Palace gardens, and arm-chairs
were placed for us on the terrace. As soon as it was
dark the gardens and the grounds around the foot
of the hill were lit up with innumerable little coloured
lamps. Rockets were let off from the valley, and we
leant back in our chairs and admired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Unreliable Interpreter.</div>

<p>Later on we had dinner out in the gardens.
Afterwards the engineer, Mr. Myddleton, asked me
if we could not leave, as he wanted to get to his
work early in the morning. I accordingly told the
Hindustani to enquire. He answered that he was
sure His Highness wished us to stay the night at
Endekki. We were exceedingly doubtful about this:
there seemed no reason why we should stay; but the
Hindustani was so certain about it that finally we
yielded, especially as the Hindustani hinted that
probably His Highness would be offended if we asked.
The real fact was, as we suspected, that the man
wanted to stay himself.</p>

<p>A comfortable little room was given us in a block
of buildings attached to the Palace and built on the
side of the hill. Charpoys and cigarettes were provided,
and waiters attended upon us.</p>

<p>We left directly after breakfast the next morning,
the brougham taking us back. Pyne had quite recovered,
and was at work in the shops. He took
the Engineer to task somewhat for remaining at the
Palace all night. I explained how we had been misled
by the Interpreter.</p>

<p>This man presently began to pay court to me.
He came frequently to see me: was very deferential
and polite: wished to teach me Persian; and he
dropped occasional innuendoes and slighting remarks
about the Armenian. He was always hanging about
the Palace whenever I went there, and with a smile
edged in a word of correction whenever the Armenian
translated. It annoyed me. I did not want his
corrections. I quite understood the Armenian, and
knew enough Persian to tell whether he were giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
me the meaning of the Amîr’s words honestly or not.
When, on the other hand, the Hindustani translated
my words to His Highness, he spoke such flowery
Persian and worked in so much Arabic that I could
not follow him. I foresaw trouble, for he was one of
those who say the thing which is not.</p>

<p>About this time a box containing presents, that I
had written home for from Turkestan, arrived, and I
sent to enquire when I might have the honour of laying
them before His Highness. A day was appointed;
and after I had amputated a man’s leg, which
happened to be arranged for the same day, I went
to the Erg Palace. His Highness received me most
graciously. He was sitting in the Octagonal Hall that
contained the pictures of the Houses of Parliament.
The portrait that I had painted of His Highness was
also hanging there. It had been sent to India to be
framed and glazed. The Amîr had had plate glass
put over it, ordering a looking glass to be bought
large enough and the silver to be scraped off the back.</p>

<p>Prince Habibullah, one or two Secretaries, and
several Page boys were in the room with His Highness
when I arrived. I sat on a couch in a convenient
position, and presently Prince Nasrullah entered. I
stood up and bowed as he went by. I do not know
whether the Prince recognized me: he did not return
my bow. He went to His Highness and salaamed.
His Highness said something to the Prince that I did
not hear, and the Prince was kind enough to return at
once to where I was sitting and enquire if I were well.
I thanked His Highness the Prince for his kind
enquiries, but I did not rise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Noah’s Ark.</div>

<p>Then the presents were examined. They were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
not of any consequence, but were such as I could
give. It had struck me that a writing-cabinet and
paper stamped with the Royal name, might be a
convenience to the Amîr. I had sent for one,
therefore, and had directed the cabinet to be decorated
with an original design in metal by an
artist friend. There were various other things,
all of which His Highness examined. For the
little Prince, Mahomed Omer, were several mechanical
toys. The Page boys gathered in a cluster
behind the Amîr, as he was examining these.
Among them was a mechanical dog that jumped
and barked, and the boys were much interested, and
there was a good deal of laughter, when one of the
Page boys snatched his hand away as the Amîr
made the dog jump at him. Then came a Noah’s
ark, with some well modelled animals, all of which
His Highness stood up on the table. A model
steam-engine excited a good deal of interest, as did
the little tin men, who walked rapidly along, dragging
their little tin carts. A toy sword and rifle
the Amîr decided to put by till the Prince was older.
For the Sultana, there were various novelties in
the way of brooches and fans; but these were not
examined at that time. Some nodding china images
amused the Amîr very much. Altogether, His Highness
must have been three hours examining everything,
for I went to the Palace at one and got back home
at five.</p>

<p>The excitement of the various Durbars and dinners
did me no good, and during the month of August&mdash;the
bad month in Kabul&mdash;I was confined to my bed.
Just at that time, His Highness sent a carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
to me for instructions, so that a framework might
be made for the canvas of a full-length portrait. I
am sorry to say the portrait was never painted.</p>

<p>Mr. Pyne called two or three times to ask me to
go for a ride with him. That being an impossibility,
he sat down and told me some amusing stories.</p>

<p>One day, the Armenian was sent for to the Durbar,
and when he returned, he told me that His Highness
had been enquiring as to my diet. I was not to
have any more beef-tea, and no brandy or whisky: I
had not drank them in Mazar, why should I drink
them in Kabul. I was to have rice and sago only.</p>

<p>Sago boiled in water for breakfast and rice
boiled in water for dinner is abominably nasty, especially
if you can vary the diet only by putting salt
in one day and leaving it out the next. I never
knew what real unadulterated hunger was till then.
I dreamed of Roast-beef and Yorkshire pudding, of
Duck and green peas, but being powerless in bed,
I had to put up with the rice and sago and&mdash;became
better. I have hated them ever since, which&mdash;in
the abstract&mdash;seems ungrateful.</p>

<p>One day they brought a man into my bedroom,
who looked even more of a scarecrow than I did.
I looked at him, asked a question or two, and said
feebly to Hafiz, the compounder,</p>

<p>“Recipe, pulveris ipecacuanhæ grana viginti,
statim sumendus”&mdash;“boiled rice and sago&mdash;bed.”
He got well before I did: he was used to the diet.
A little girl of eleven, who had had fever for six
months, was brought by His Highness’s orders: all
she needed was quinine.</p>

<p>Shere Ali Khan, my friend of Mazar, called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
see me one day while the Armenian was out, and
we had a long and amusing conversation in Persian,
supplemented occasionally by signs. We quite understood
one another. We discussed anatomy, climate,
diamonds, marriage; and I remember we compared
the customs of European ladies with those of Oriental
ladies. Shere Ali defended polygamy. We had an
earthquake in the evening&mdash;not that it had anything
to do with the conversation. At different times many
people called. Some of them were ill and wished to
be prescribed for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illness of Amîr.</div>

<p>In the beginning of September, I heard that His
Highness was ill with gout, and I wrote to ask if I
should come and see him. The answer came that I
was to visit him the next day. Accordingly, I
gathered myself together, mounted my horse, and
rode slowly to the Erg Palace. The Armenian had
brought me a walking-stick, so that I could get
across the Palace gardens. I found His Highness
was in one of the upper rooms. Getting upstairs
was rather breathless work, and I had to take my
time over it.</p>

<p>In the lobby outside the room were several Military
Officers and Secretaries seated on the ground.
Through the open door I saw His Highness lying on
a couch. I bowed, and he called me in. The room
was very small, and a chair was put for me near the
head of the bed. Tea was brought for me in a glass
mug set in silver. His Highness then described to
me his symptoms. He had gouty inflammation of
the right foot and knee; pains in most of his joints,
and sciatica: he was feverish and shivering. I told
him what treatment I should adopt if I had charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the case. His Highness said that the Hakims, who
were attending him, had bled him, and had leeched
the inflamed joints. I said I hoped the treatment
would not make him worse afterwards. By-and-bye
I took my leave.</p>

<p>I went the next day to see His Highness, and he
expressed himself as feeling much better. The pain
was nearly gone. He told me that he had procured
an oil from the colchicum plant, and this had been
gently rubbed into the inflamed joints.</p>

<p>Two Page boys were in the room. One was
“massaging” His Highness’s painful leg, and the other
waving away flies with a fan. His Highness spoke
very kindly to me, and suddenly asked if I intended
to marry when I went to England on leave. I was
rather taken aback when he asked, whereat the Page
boys smiled; but, summoning up courage, I said yes.
His Highness promised me a very substantial wedding
present. Later on, after we had had tea, I heard the
hubble-bubble going round in the next room, and
mechanically pulling out a cigar I began cutting the
tip off. Suddenly it struck me I was in the King’s
bedroom. I felt somewhat ashamed, for I had not
been invited to smoke. However, His Highness had
seen me take the cigar out; and I rather lamely asked
if he minded the smell of smoke. He said, “Not in
the least,” and, seeing my confusion, he at once put
me at my ease by calling for a cigarette, which he lit
and smoked.</p>

<p>The next morning early my house was found to be
on fire: fortunately it was discovered in time, and
the neighbours were <em>not</em> fined for setting it alight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Earthquake.</div>

<p>That night I was awakened suddenly by an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
earthquake. The heaving of the floor, the creaking
of the beams, and the rattling of the windows increased
and increased. I sprang out of bed and tried to light
a candle. I could not find the matchbox; then I
found it, opened it, took a match hurriedly, and broke
it: took another and tried to strike the wrong end,
then another, and I began to think whether I hadn’t
better make a bolt for it at once. At last I got a
light and the candle caught: it was half-past one. I
stood a moment or two with the candle in my hand,
and presently I fancied the rocking and creaking was
becoming less: then it occurred to me that, after all,
the house had stood so many earthquakes, that may be
it would stand another, and I waited a little longer:
it really did become less, and finally died away.
The shocks lasted several minutes. Afterwards I
walked round with my candle to look for cracks.
There was only one of any consequence; but that I
could put my hand into. However, I did not think it
mattered very much, for the beams went the other
way, and if the worst came, only the end of the room
would fall out: so I went to bed again.</p>

<p>After this I got to work again at the Hospital. I
attended regularly at a certain hour in the morning;
the patients daily increased so in number, to nearly
two hundred a day, that at the end of the week I
became feverish with a Hospital throat. This was
very annoying, for I had to stop away for a couple of
days. I was afraid His Highness would begin to think
he had made a bad bargain in engaging a Doctor who
was generally ill, or fancied himself so. However, I
was soon better, and on the following Sunday went to
the Palace to lay a report before the Amîr. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Highness had asked me to test the purity of the spirit,
“Brandy, Whisky, and Old Tom,” that was being
made in the Kabul Distillery.</p>

<p>I found His Highness downstairs in one of the
small rooms of the Erg Palace that open from the
Octagonal hall. He was lying on a fur-covered couch
heaped with pillows. He looked better than he had
done, though he still had some gouty pains in the
right knee.</p>

<p>The room was small, but very pretty. There
were mirrors let into the wall, which made the
room seem larger.</p>

<p>Outside the large wide window opening into the
gardens was erected a crimson and white awning.
Here were grouped the officials who had to see His
Highness on business. I sat inside, near the Amîr’s
couch, and the air was sweet with scent from the
clusters of roses which filled the vases in the room.
A few Page boys were there. His Highness described
to me the trouble he had had in getting down
stairs with his gouty knee; and he gave me further
details as to the treatment he was undergoing for the
gout: how that he had been bled and leeched frequently,
and that when the pain in his foot was
very severe it had been necessary to plunge the foot
into iced water!</p>

<p>Tea was brought in: His Highness said that
green tea was not good for me in my state of health;
he therefore ordered black tea to be brought, and he
made me a present of several pounds.</p>

<p>I then gave my report as to the Spirit. It was
made from the fermentation of raisins, and distilled
in a proper still; but the so-called Brandy, Whisky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and “Old Tom” were simply the raw spirit coloured
and flavoured with native drugs: none of it was fit
for human consumption, and those who drank it
became ill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Perplexity.</div>

<p>Presently, Mr. Pyne was announced. He also
gave an opinion concerning the spirit: he said it was
not good, but at the same time admitted that it
would sell in Peshawur. The Hindustani interpreted
for him: I do not know what he said, I could not
follow the Persian, but His Highness seemed perplexed.
He said that since the opinion of two of his
European servants disagreed he would send the spirit
to Calcutta to be tested.</p>

<p>The maker of the spirit was a Hindu, who, I understood,
had been imported into the country by the
Hindustani Interpreter.</p>

<p>I remember that one of the objections the Hindu
and the Hindustani made to my report was that I
had said “Gin” instead of “Old Tom.” They said
the spirit was not gin (they were quite right), but
that it was “Old Tom”! I let the matter pass: it
seemed too absurd to argue on the point. Meanwhile
the making of Spirit was to be continued, but
that of “Brandy, Whisky, and Old Tom” to be stopped
till further information on the subject was obtained.</p>

<p>A few nights after the Durbar I was awakened
about midnight by an extraordinary and mysterious
noise that seemed to come “whiffling by.” It was
followed in a few seconds by a shorter and sharper
noise which literally made the earth shake. I had
never felt an earthquake like that before, and I wondered
what was coming next. Dogs were barking,
horses neighing, and men shouting. The noise woke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
up everybody. We listened and listened, but there
was no repetition, and I went to sleep again. The
next morning we heard the solution of the mystery.
The rocket and firework factory in Kabul had blown
up. It was not very far from the workshops, and
Pyne told me he thought he should have been thrown
out of bed. I enquired as to the loss of life, and heard
that some people had been killed, but no one seemed
very interested in that line of enquiry. Nor did I
ever hear the cause of the explosion accounted for.
Doubtless it was “Kismet.”</p>

<p>We had an epidemic of “mumps” in Kabul at the
time, I remember, and the Hindustani Hospital assistant,
the gentlemanly Dipsomaniac, had it rather badly.</p>

<p>In the beginning of October I received an invitation
from Her Highness the Sultana to attend the Reception
after the wedding of Prince Nasrullah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wedding of Prince Nasrullah.</div>

<p>It was quite a fête, and was held in the Baburshah
gardens, about a mile and a half out of the town, on
the banks of the Kabul river.</p>

<p>The Invitation said seven a.m., but I started about
half-past nine. The day was bright and sunny, like
an August day in England.</p>

<p>I rode, accompanied by the Armenian; and the
servants walked in front and by the side of the horses
after the manner of the country. I put on all my
finery, including the medal His Highness had given
me. The garden was gay with many-coloured tents
and awnings, and crowded with Orientals in gala
costume. The green of the grass and trees; the hazy
red and blue of the mountains; the gleam and ripple
of the river: all these, with the gay colours, made a
beautiful picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince had not arrived, and I went to a large
tent where the Commander-in-Chief, the Officers, and
Chief Secretaries were, and sat and chatted with
them till the Prince arrived.</p>

<p>Presently His Highness sent for me. I found him
seated under a large awning surrounded by Courtiers,
who were standing. There were many others seated
cross-legged on the ground in a semicircle in front
of him. I stopped outside the circle and bowed with
my hat off. A chair was placed exactly in the middle
of the circle, opposite to the Prince, and he beckoned
me to sit there. I offered my congratulations; the
Prince kindly enquired after my health; and complimentary
speeches were exchanged.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the Commander-in-Chief, the
Officers, and Secretaries came to salaam His Highness,
and I bowed and retired.</p>

<p>I was then conducted to a tent on the bank, which
was made ready for me, and tea and cigarettes were
brought by order of the Sultana, whose guest I was.</p>

<p>Directly I had arrived at the garden I had sent
in my salaams to the Sultana. She, with the bride
and the attendants of the Harem were in a small
walled garden apart. His Highness the Amîr was
not present. He was still suffering somewhat from
the gouty attack.</p>

<p>By-and-bye Mr. Pyne and the Engineers arrived,
and they came to my tent. At noon the Sultana gave
orders for lunch to be served to us. It was cooked
in the native fashion, and consisted of pilau and the
various other native dishes.</p>

<p>After lunch Mr. Pyne and the Engineers went to
pay their respects to the Prince and then started for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
home again; but the Sultana sent a request for them
to stay longer.</p>

<p>The Armenian enquired if we should like some
music, and he sent for a band of pipers. They
marched with their bagpipes up and down in front
of the tent playing Scotch and Afghan tunes. There
were several other bands about the garden&mdash;brass
bands and native string bands&mdash;playing military and
native music. There were dancing boys, conjurers,
and nautch girls.</p>

<p>The chief men lunched in tents and the crowds of
people had a picnic on the grass; pilau and bread
being provided for them.</p>

<p>About two the Sultana sent a huge tray of sweetmeats
with which we regaled ourselves. At half-past
two the fête was over and we came away. The roads
were lined with troops, for the Sultana, the ladies, and
the Princes had not yet left.</p>

<p>For a few days before and after the wedding
volleys of musketry were fired at intervals, and
bands were playing nearly all day.</p>

<p>I heard a story at the time about the Prince and
his Bride which is interesting. When the Prince
was very small he was very fond of a particular girl
in the Harem&mdash;a gentlewoman&mdash;and he said that
when he was old enough he would make her his wife.
The girl was considerably older than he was, and it
is said that in the course of years the Prince’s views
changed. His Highness the Amîr, however, decided
that since he was a Prince, and had passed his word,
he should certainly keep it. In due time the word
was kept. This was the wedding.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Troubles of a Ruler.</div>

<p>At the Hospital the work was getting rather over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>whelming.
I was not strong yet, but if I appeared at
the Hospital at all, I had to see everyone. At the
hundred and twentieth or thirtieth patient the backache
came on horribly. If I did not go the patients
crowded round the door of the Hospital and said,
“When is the Doctor coming; ask him to come for
God’s sake.” What could I do? I was obliged to go.
If I had been strong I should have enjoyed it, but the
overwork delayed my recovery, and I became much
depressed. I thought of resigning and coming away,
but I knew His Highness was not yet well, and in
addition he had just then the annoyance of finding
evidence of intrigue and swindling among some of the
higher Officials: heavy fines were imposed, and there
were extensive alterations in the higher appointments.
I did not want to add to his annoyances by resigning;
but to my last day I shall never forget the weary
drag of that and the immediately succeeding time.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Sabbath, I went for a ride with the
Armenian. We rode east from Kabul past the Bala
Hissar, where Cavagnari was, and round the huge
marsh or lake that lies in the middle of the Kabul
Valley. All around were the mountains, and between
them and the lake were fields of clover, stubble where
corn had been, gardens, trees, and fortified country
houses. The lake is in some parts very deep and in
others shallow. Here the rushes grow thick, making
a cover for huge numbers of wild duck that flock to
Kabul in the autumn and winter. A great deal of the
land about the marsh belongs to His Highness’ sister.
We passed her country house&mdash;a fort. We saw also
the tomb where the Amîr’s father is buried. At the
extreme east of the lake, near the village of Bîni<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Hissar, the road took us a little up the foot of the
mountain. I pulled up a few minutes to admire the
view.</p>

<p>In the foreground, on the margin of the lake,
was one tree coloured golden-yellow by the autumn:
near it were others still green. Beyond were brown
rushes and the lake. Further, on the opposite bank,
the trees, massed together, were tinted all shades of
green, brown, and yellow. Then rose up the hazy
purple mountains, range beyond range, dim and
shadowy in the distance, and above, the blue of the sky
flecked here and there by little white clouds.</p>

<p>I was charmed&mdash;but I could not rouse any
enthusiasm in the Armenian. Like most Orientals
he looked upon an afternoon ride as an unnecessary
and laborious nuisance; still he would not consent to
my going alone.</p>

<p>In the autumn and winter the Amîr and the
Princes ride duck shooting through the shallow parts
of the marsh.</p>

<p>One day, some two or three years after the time
of which I am writing, I was riding in this direction
with Mr. Collins, the geologist, when, just as
we rounded the corner of the Peshawur Road, which
leads off directly opposite the Bala Hissar, we
heard the rattle of kettledrums. We pulled up,
knowing that the Amîr must be at hand. Presently,
there came in sight right opposite the Bala Hissar
the Amîr’s mounted guard of Barakzais. Then came
the drummers, who rode just in front of His
Highness. We dismounted as the Amîr approached.
He was seated in his palanquin, and the bearers
scuffled along rapidly, leaning on the pole. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Highness carries a walking-stick when he rides in
the palanquin, and if the pace is not speedy enough,
the nearest bearer receives a reminder in the shape
of a prod in the back. His Highness, when he saw
us, halted the cavalcade and enquired if we were
well. He told us he had been duck shooting on the
Bala Hissar marsh.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight. The young Page boys in
their gold-embroidered uniforms scampered about on
their horses. The guard rode steadily, and the
servants, with their turbans and many-coloured
garments&mdash;one with the chillim, another with a
charcoal brazier, a third with a samovar for tea, a
fourth with the Amîr’s chair, and so on&mdash;these
followed in great numbers. Altogether, with the background
of the Bala Hissar, it made a striking sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sick Chief.</div>

<p>At the end of October, the Chief, whose brother
was at the Court of the Amîr as hostage, came to
Kabul to salaam His Highness. The brother, whom
I knew in Turkestan, called one morning upon me
to say that the Chief, who had wished to come and
see me, was ill with fever; would I visit and prescribe
for him. Accordingly, I accompanied my friend to
the house the Chief had taken in Kabul. A large
following of dependants and servants had arrived
with him. They treated me with great respect, and
I was shown in an upper-room, where the Chief
lay ill with fever. He was a broad-shouldered stout
man, about five feet seven inches in height, and I
should say about thirty-five years old. He was not
alone: the room was nearly full of people; I think
an Afghan hates nothing more than his own company:
he is bored in no time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>The province belonging to the Chief has a very
hot climate. It lies in the south-east. In Kabul,
at this time, though the sun was still hot, there
was a cutting wind blowing, and the Chief and his
people did not wrap themselves up as they should
have done.</p>

<p>Tea, cigars, and sweets were brought, and after
examining the Chief’s condition, I sat and talked to
him and his brother for some time. He was an
intelligent man. One of his favourite amusements
was photography; he dabbled, too, in chemistry, and
showed me a scar in his hand, where he had been
injured by an explosion when he was learning something
about the science. Afterwards, I examined
some of his retinue; eight of them were ill with the
fever.</p>

<p>This Chief was beloved, or admired&mdash;or whatever
the corresponding sentiment is in an Afghan’s bosom&mdash;by
his Clansmen. But in the eyes of His Highness
he was as a poppy grown very tall. It was necessary
that something be done lest he should overtop all other
flowers. He had, I heard, been receiving a subsidy
of a lac of rupees a year from the Afghan Government.
This was altered: and while he was in
Kabul, a new “Governor” was sent to take command
in his province. This was not pleasing to the
Clansmen: they did not love&mdash;or whatever the sentiment
is&mdash;the Governor as they did the Chief, for he
was a stranger. They, therefore, slew him. Another
was sent; him they also slew, and the Chief was
by-and-bye allowed to return to his Province, though
without the subsidy.</p>

<p>In the early part of November I was sent for to the
Erg Palace. When I arrived, His Highness was
sitting on a couch or divan covered with a cloth of
dull crimson velvet and gold. He was dressed in a
robe of green velvet and gold with a white turban.
The couch was in the small room that opens on one
side into the Octagonal hall, and on the other into the
gardens. His Highness said that he still had some
pain in the knee and foot, and he would be glad if
I would send him a liniment that would take away
the pain and enable him to ride.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Questions in Chemistry.</div>

<p>Afterwards he asked my opinion with regard to
the action of certain acids of native production, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
we tried some experiments upon copper and brass.
His Highness wanted an acid that could be procured
cheaply, for the purpose of cleaning copper cartridge
cases.</p>

<p>The next day I went to the Palace again, taking
with me a liniment. Presently Malek, the favourite
Page, came out, and seeing me waiting in the gardens
among the Secretaries, came up and asked if he
should take the medicine in and say I had arrived.
He soon came out again, and I was called in with
the Armenian. We sat in one of the small rooms or
alcoves, waiting. His Highness was not visible when
I went in. He was in the room he had occupied the
day before, but it was curtained off from the Octagonal
hall. Two or three of the Page boys came up
and asked when I was going to London. I began to
think my “leave of absence” had been mentioned
by the Amîr. Just then His Highness appeared;
he was fully dressed, and walked with the aid of
a stick. We all rose and bowed. A table and
chair were placed for him in the room where we
were. He spoke to me about his health, and asked
me the properties of the liniment, saying it had a
pleasant smell.</p>

<p>Presently the “early breakfast” was brought for
the Amîr on a silver tray. It consisted of tea, which
he drank out of a glass mug set in silver, hot milk,
and some cakes and macaroons. A table and tea
were brought for me, and I sat opposite to him. The
others sat on the ground and tea was carried round
to them by the servants. His Highness did not eat
anything, and he told one of the Courtiers, Naim
Khan, to bring the tray to me. I do not know if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
Naim liked being a waiter for once in a way, but
he obeyed at once. However, he was a good fellow,
about twenty-six, and was always a friend of mine,
so I do not think he minded very much. He was
very smart, with a pale blue&mdash;almost grey&mdash;brocaded
silk postîn and a beaver busby. The
Amîr asked me to visit the Deputy Commander-in-Chief,
Perwana Khan, who was ill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prince Aziz Ullah.</div>

<p>I returned to the Hospital, but in the afternoon
was sent for again by His Highness. He asked
me to examine and prescribe for his infant son,
Prince Aziz Ullah, who, the Hakims informed him,
was suffering from disease of the ear. I went off to
the Harem Serai at once, and presently the child was
brought out into the waiting-room. He was carried
in the arms of an old man. The child was about
two years old, and was the son of one of the minor
ladies of the Harem. He was a pretty little fellow,
with large dark eyes and a fair skin. I looked
at him as he was being brought out, and saw a
dusky livid appearance about the lips; and that the
nostrils worked at each breath.</p>

<p>“A bad ear!” I thought. “If that is not lungs,
I am an Afghan!”</p>

<p>I put my ear on his back, and the bubbling and
crackling of the air as it was sucked through
the inflamed bronchial tubes was loud enough
for even a Hakim to hear. I asked how long he had
been like that. Twenty days! He was suffering from
broncho-pneumonia following measles. The ear was
a trivial matter.</p>

<p>Perwana Khan was suffering, the Hakim said, from
colic. I found he had a stone in the kidney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>The same day I received a letter from Prince
Habibullah asking me to attend Sirdar Ressùl Khan,
the Amîr’s cousin, son of Sirdar Usuf, who is the son
of Amîr Dôst Mahomed. Sirdar Ressùl had a crippled
arm: he had injured it some time before while out
duck shooting.</p>

<p>I was told that the liniment relieved the Amîr’s
pain at once; but I do not know&mdash;it may have been
merely Oriental politeness that led them to say so. I
did not see His Highness for some days, as he was the
guest of the Dabier-ul-Mulk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Visit to Prince Mahomed Omer.</div>

<p>A day or two afterwards, as I had not seen the
little Prince, Mahomed Omer, since my illness, I wrote
to the Sultana for permission to visit him.</p>

<p>He was living with the Sultana, at a place about
ten miles out of Kabul: the country house of one of
the Chief Secretaries, Mir Ahmad Shah, having been
placed at Her Highness’ service.</p>

<p>The Sultana was kind enough to send her brougham
and pair for me. The roads were very good, and I
felt very important riding rapidly along in the Queen’s
carriage.</p>

<p>We reached the Prince’s quarters. He had a
separate establishment from the Sultana, and I was
conducted to a crimson and blue tent. Tea, cigars,
and sweets were brought while my salaams were
carried to the Prince and word was taken to the
Sultana that I had arrived. After staying there about
an hour, we got into the carriage again and drove
about half a mile further on to the Port, where the
Sultana was living. Here I was received in a large
many-coloured silk tent by the Sultana’s uncle (on
her father’s side). This gentleman is a Seyid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
Priest, and is addressed by the title of “Pir” or
Reverend.</p>

<p>My chair was placed at the end of the tent, by the
side of that of the Reverend gentleman, on a cloth of
gold. The others, including the Armenian, sat on the
ground along the sides of the tent, some distance from
us. I perceived that the Sultana did things in style.
Many polite speeches were made, and kind messages
brought from Her Highness. Trays of sweetmeats
then appeared, native ones&mdash;and delicious. I went for
them vigorously, for since my illness I had an intense
craving for sweets, butter, and all fattening things.
Cigars and tea followed, and, after an interval,
fruit. There were apples, pears, grapes, quinces,
melons, and other fruit. Then came lunch, an
elaborate one, in the native style, and uncommonly
good I thought it. More cigars, fruit, and conversation
followed.</p>

<p>I did not see the little Prince after all, because the
weather was considered too cold to bring him out.</p>

<p>I then asked permission to retire, but before I
went Her Highness presented me with a beautiful
little Kataghani horse, which, I was informed, she had
chosen herself.</p>

<p>We entered the carriage again and drove back to
Kabul, arriving home at five p.m.</p>

<p>I then went to the Harem Serai to see little
Prince Aziz Ullah, but the chance of his recovery was
small.</p>

<p>Then I saw an old gentleman, named Saîf Ullah
Khan, one of the high officials of Jelalabad, who was
on a visit to Kabul. He had fever. He was a very
gentlemanly old man, and asked if he could do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
for me in Jelalabad. I said he could send me some
honey if he wished; for a delicious honey is obtained
from a village near Jelalabad. He promised; but did
not send it.</p>

<p>I dined with Mr. Pyne soon after this, and an
excellent dinner he gave me. He had brought a large
stock of tinned provisions from India during his last
trip. Pastry, asparagus, green peas, cheese, cocoa,
and Swiss milk were novelties to me. He was lucky
enough to get away every cold season, and generally
journeyed to England for more machinery.</p>

<p>It had been thought that little Prince Aziz Ullah
was becoming somewhat better, but in spite of colour
in the cheeks he had the greyness about the nostrils
that is so ominous of evil in a child, and I sent word
to his mother that his life was in great danger. He
died the next morning; five days after my first visit.</p>

<p>The Chief with fever became well, but he would
not take advice and wrap himself up. Either from
that, or some other cause, he developed acute intestinal
catarrh; and the Amîr sent word to me to visit
him. He became well eventually, and went back to
his province.</p>

<p>Just at this time&mdash;the end of November&mdash;the
weather was most disagreeable. There were heavy
clouds and constant rain. This is bad enough in
England, but in Kabul it is abominable. The rain
made havoc with the roads and houses. Very few
of the roads were in any sense “macadamized,” and
one splashed and slipped along through quagmires
and pools. The houses, especially of the poorer people,
slightly built of mud with wooden supports, were,
some of them, literally washed down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span></p>

<p>I went about my daily work in Kabul, seeing
patients, performing surgical operations where necessary;
and in the evenings I smoked and read my old
books over and over again, little knowing that the
Amîr had had a severe return of gout and was lying
dangerously ill at the Palace. News leaks out in time,
chiefly by means of the Page boys, but it is little
outsiders know at first of what is going on in the
Palace.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Call at Night.</div>

<p>On December 2nd, at nine p.m., just as I had
turned in, there came a hammering at the gates.
Presently one of the soldiers of the guard came
hurrying to my room and said, in Persian,</p>

<p>“Rise! Amîr Sahib calls you.”</p>

<p>I pulled on my boots, threw on a postîn, and in a
very few seconds was in the porch. Quick as I had
been, I found my horse saddled and bridled. I rode
rapidly along the dark deserted streets, slippery with
wet, the puddles glistening in the light of an occasional
lamp: a soldier was in front and a soldier
behind me. Then I heard the clatter and splash of
other horses, and looking back saw the Armenian
advancing rapidly, accompanied by the soldier who
had called him. This was somewhat of a relief to me,
for I did not know the soldiers, and the Armenian was
always a protection. I guessed now that the Amîr
was ill, and that the time had arrived when he wished
to undergo European medical treatment. Presently
we arrived at the Erg Palace, and, leaving our horses
at the gate, were at once admitted by the sentry.
We hurried across the gardens to the Amîr’s Pavilion.
Entering at once we passed through the Octagonal
Hall, and in the small room opposite the entry I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
the Amîr lying back on the pillows of his couch. He
was rolling his head from side to side and groaning
in great pain. Malek, the Page, was kneeling on the
couch rubbing His Highness’s knee. The two eldest
sons, the Princes Habibullah and Nasrullah, were in
the room with the Amîr, as were Perwana Khan, Jan
Mahomed Khan, the Dabier-ul-Mulk, Mir Ahmad
Shah&mdash;in fact, most of the principal officers of the
Kingdom who were in Kabul at the time. These
were kneeling around the room. Everyone had a
look of strained and anxious attention.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the Amîr was very ill, and I
said in English to the Armenian,</p>

<p>“Enquire if His Highness wishes to place himself
under my medical care.”</p>

<p>His Highness, turning his head and looking at
me, said, “Bâli! I wish it.”</p>

<p>I laid down my turban, removed the spurs from
my boots, and set to work to examine His Highness’s
condition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illness of the Amîr.</div>

<p>He had acute gouty inflammation of the right
shoulder, elbow, wrist, and knee, and shooting neuralgic
pains in the left calf. There was coarse crepitation
of the left axillary base, with cough; some enlargement
of the heart; extreme vesical irritability, and
faucial congestion; and albuminuria to the extent
roughly of a fifth. His temperature was 102 degrees
Fahr.: the pulse weak; and I was informed that he
had had no sleep for several nights.</p>

<p>I sat down a minute to consider what I would do.
The condition was serious: for the Amîr had been ill,
on and off, to my knowledge, since September the 9th,
and possibly longer. The medical treatment to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
he had been subjected by the Hakims for his complaint
was, to my mind, unscientific, and even dangerous.
He had been bled, I was informed, nearly to faintness,
and leeched freely several times: he had been
purged violently and often: and his gouty foot had
been plunged into iced water. What else was done
I do not know; but this was enough.</p>

<p>A lantern being procured, I went at once to the
Hospital, which is at the edge of the Palace gardens,
and obtained such medicines as I needed. I was
accompanied by the Hindustani Priest-doctor, who
was accused of murdering his Superior Officer in India,
and who, as I have mentioned, was not under my
orders. We returned to the Palace, and the medicines
were placed in charge of a trusted Page.</p>

<p>I weighed and measured the medicines in suitable
doses, and when they were dissolved I handed the
glass to His Highness. It did not enter my head to
taste a dose of the medicine in front of His Highness,
nor did he ever require me to do so. His Highness
took the glass, and, murmuring,</p>

<p>“In the name of God&mdash;the merciful and compassionate,”
he drank the contents.</p>

<p>I fomented the inflamed joints with hot water,
applying suitable medicines, and finally bandaged
them gently in cotton-wool and tissue. I then
requested as many as I could ask, to withdraw, in
the hope that His Highness might sleep; and I went
into an adjoining room. I did not give His Highness
any opiate or other sleeping draught, wishing rather
to trust to the effect of the medicines I had given
him. I ought to say that His Highness, with a
courtesy that never leaves him, gave orders for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
meals and suitable accommodation for sleeping
to be prepared for me in the adjoining room or
alcove. In half-an-hour His Highness slept. The
Princes left very quietly about two hours afterwards.</p>

<p>I need not say that, though a couch, covered
with silk and gold embroidery, had been prepared
for me, I did not lie down. I had supper, which
was brought silently by the chief cook: and then, at
intervals during the night, stole in to look at the
Royal patient. Exhausted by suffering and want of
rest, and relieved by the action of the medicines, he
slept soundly for three or four hours.</p>

<p>In the early morning His Highness woke: he
expressed himself as nearly free from pain, and
was most grateful to me. I administered the
medicines, again applied the fomentations and
regulated His Highness’s diet.</p>

<p>Everyone made much of me, from Prince to
Page boy. Daily I was required to send a written
report of the Amîr’s condition to Her Highness,
the Sultana, and to Prince Habibullah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illness of the Sultana.</div>

<p>The next day, I was called to the Harem Serai,
for the Sultana was very ill. The Amîr directed
me to attend Her Highness.</p>

<p>I, therefore, left the Amîr’s Pavilion and, by
His Highness’s order, was accompanied by the Priest-doctor,
to the Harem Serai. The great gates were
opened by an old white-bearded man, and we were
admitted into a covered portico. The old man left
us a moment, and on returning, he ushered us into a
large paved quadrangle surrounded by high white
buildings. No one was to be seen. We crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
the silent quadrangle, and passing up some steps
entered a building on the north side.</p>

<p>An open door led from the lobby at the top
of the steps into a long corridor, curtained and
carpeted, but otherwise empty. At the end was
a door, to enter which we ascended three steps.
We now found ourselves in a large room at right
angles to the corridor, and lighted by a window at
the end. Towards the other end of the room a thin
crimson silk curtain was stretched entirely across.
The room was furnished very like an English
drawing-room. A carpet was on the floor, curtains by
the windows, pictures on the wall, and several tables
by the side of the wall, on which were vases, candelabra,
and china ornaments. In nearly the centre
of the room there was standing on the floor a large
and very ornamental glass candelabrum, about six
feet high. There were three or four little Page boys
in the room, about nine or ten years of age.</p>

<p>As we entered, a voice from behind the curtain
pronounced the usual Persian salutation of welcome.
It was the Sultana speaking. She had a deep, musical
voice. I bowed and advanced. A chair was
placed for me near the curtain, and tea and cigarettes
were brought. After I had tasted the tea, Her
Highness requested me to smoke. Accordingly, I
lit a cigarette, and I heard from behind the curtain
the bubble of the chillim. The Sultana
then commenced describing her symptoms, but the
Hindustani Priest-doctor had an imperfect knowledge
of English, and he asked that an Interpreter
might be sent for. A messenger was at once sent
for the Armenian, who presently entered saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
with a bow, “Salaam, Aleikoum.” He took his
stand near me.</p>

<p>The Sultana raised the curtain sufficiently to pass
her hand underneath, and I examined the pulse. It
was rapid (133), and weak. I perceived that she was
lying on a couch&mdash;and that the hand was white, and
was that of a young woman. I described the use of
the clinical thermometer, and handed it to her.
When she returned it to me the indicator marked a
temperature of 105 degrees Fahr.</p>

<p>She complained of cough, and with some little
difficulty I managed, by asking her to stand, to listen
to the sounds of the chest through the curtain, using
a straight wooden stethoscope. Not knowing the
height of Her Highness, I nearly struck her in the
face in endeavouring to find the position of the
chest, and she cried out: however, she laughed
when she heard of my difficulty.</p>

<p>She had bronchial catarrh: there were no morbid
cardiac sounds; and she had Malarial fever. I
enquired as to the history of the illness, and the
habits of the patient, and heard that she was accustomed
to inhale tobacco-smoke from the chillim
pretty much all day; and that in order to procure
sleep she was accustomed to take sixty grains of
chloral nightly!</p>

<p>I advised the cessation of smoking for a time,
and the Sultana laughed.</p>

<p>After about an hour, I asked permission to retire.
I prescribed quinine and a cough mixture; but in
the evening, to my horror, I was called upon to
weigh out the usual dose of chloral, tie down the cork
of the bottle, and seal it with my own seal. Sleep!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
of course I did not sleep. If a lie had been told me
about the dose, the Sultana would be found dead
in the morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Amîr was distinctly better that day,
though of course he was still very ill. The temperature
was normal: the vesical irritability had disappeared:
there was no difficulty in swallowing; and
the pain in the joints was less.</p>

<p>The next morning the Sultana was somewhat
better. The relief to my mind cannot be described:
I will not attempt it. In my visit to the Sultana
that day I again urged upon her the advisability,
if she wished to get rid of her cough, of ceasing to
smoke,&mdash;at any rate for a time. She would not listen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Innocent Plot.</div>

<p>I explained to the Amîr my difficulty with Her
Highness, and he arranged a plan in which she
could be beguiled into smoking less. I weighed
out a little less chloral that evening.</p>

<p>I visited the Amîr every two or three hours
during the day, examining his condition. He still
had some pain, though vastly less than he had had,
and the cough was better.</p>

<p>At two in the morning I was sent for by the
Sultana. She detailed to me the whole of the innocent
plot that had been arranged to draw her from the
chillim, and laughed at me for thinking she could
be so easily beguiled.</p>

<p>I concluded there were certain in the Amîr’s court
who brought minute details of what occurred there
to the Harem Serai.</p>

<p>The Sultana did not seem angry, for she ordered
to be brought for me a present of Cashmere shawls,
embroidery, and furs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>The Amîr that day had some burning pain in
the hand and foot, but it yielded to treatment, and
he was quite bright in the evening, laughing heartily
several times. Musicians and dancing girls were sent
for and many of the chief Officials visited the Palace.
His Highness did not sleep well that night.</p>

<p>The next day&mdash;the fifth of my attendance&mdash;the
Amîr felt better, there was very little pain, and the
cough was less. He could not sleep, however; and in
the afternoon there was a return of pain in the knee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was nearly worn out with want of
sleep and anxiety. The Amîr was a good patient,
considering that he was an Oriental King. He would
take what medicine and food I advised, but I could
not regulate such matters as the number of visitors
he should receive, nor even such a thing as the
admission of musicians.</p>

<p>The Sultana, on the other hand, was anything but
a good patient. She would not do as I advised, and
she wished me to give her just what medicines she
thought best.</p>

<p>Added to all this, I was greatly embarrassed
and annoyed by the Hindustani Interpreter, whom
I did not trust. He was always at the Court;
and he constantly interrupted the Armenian before
the Amîr, and corrected him when there was no need.
I told him to “Chûp!”&mdash;“shut up”&mdash;once or twice,
but it was not enough, and the fifth night I called
him into my room, and in a low voice told him&mdash;I
admit, harshly&mdash;that I did not need either his corrections
or interference: that the Armenian was my
Interpreter; and that he could hold his tongue till
he was called upon to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>That night His Highness was restless, and in the
morning (Sunday) to my amazement he said he would
take no more European medicine! I was aghast!
He was much better. What had displeased him?
But I was worn out, and I went to my room and
lay on the bed in my clothes&mdash;I had never taken
them off&mdash;and went sound asleep.</p>

<p>By-and-bye I was aroused; the Sultana had sent
for me as soon as she had awakened from the sleeping-draught.</p>

<p>The Armenian told her that His Highness had
ceased taking European medicine. She was
astonished and alarmed, and at once wrote a letter
to the Amîr. She asked him what it all meant&mdash;she
read the letter to me&mdash;asked whether he were
a King or a boy. At one time he said the English
Doctor was all that was wise and learned, and the
next he ceased taking his medicine: was he going
back to the Hakims who had killed his father and
his father’s father! Why was this?</p>

<p>The answer from the Amîr arrived: the Sultana
read it to me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sultana’s Letter: the Answer.</div>

<p>His Highness said he was a King and no boy; but
he added that there was quarrelling between two
Interpreters and he feared there would be a mistranslation
and that he should suffer. For this reason
he considered it better that he should cease taking
European medicine for the present. He was not
angry with the English Doctor: on the contrary, he
realized the benefit he had received from his treatment,
and would resume his medicine when the suitable
time arrived.</p>

<p>That night Malek, the Page, came to me. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
said that the Hindustani had crept to the Amîr in
the morning, and had whispered this story: He
had implored me to give <em>good</em> medicine to the Amîr:
and that at once I had wished to kick and strike
him; that I was giving His Highness alcohol in all
his medicines, and it was this that lulled the pain,
though it would afterwards make him worse: that he
had heard me say I had only this one medicine that
could affect His Highness!</p>

<p>I could not find it in my heart to blame the
Amîr. Wearied out with months of suffering, he
lacked the keen judgment that is his characteristic.
Nevertheless, in a matter of such vast importance,
the fact, that <em>any</em> condition could place one at the
mercy of an obscure intriguing Hindustani, gave
such a shock to my confidence that I never entirely
recovered it while I was in the service of the Amîr.
Once in a lifetime was enough for such an experience
as I had been through; for had the illness
of either Amîr or Sultana terminated fatally, while
they were under my care, <em>my</em> fate would have been
sufficiently appalling.</p>

<p>I was to visit His Highness daily, although he
was under the care of the Hakims. His manner to
me was never so kind as now. I examined his
condition as before, and he described to me the
treatment the Hakims were subjecting him to.</p>

<p>They had no specific medicine, but administered
drugs that produced frequent and copious alvine
evacuations. I said one day&mdash;in my anxiety&mdash;that
I feared they were, in His Highness’s feeble condition,
overdoing this line of treatment. His Highness
rebuked me and said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>“When I am under the care of Hakims, I do
as Hakims say; when under your care, as you say.”</p>

<p>I continued attending the Sultana. She was
much better and was very kind. She read poetry to
me, and commenced teaching me to talk Persian. One
day she said in Persian,</p>

<p>“Say this &mdash;&mdash;” and she repeated some sentence.</p>

<p>In my weariness, for it was in the middle of the
night, I mechanically repeated after her, “Say this &mdash;&mdash;” and I gave the sentence. At once the Page
boys and the girls behind the curtains burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>As we came away I said to the Armenian,
“Why were you so sulky to-night?”</p>

<p>He had sat very glum in the Harem Serai. He
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, you European, and, perhaps, no harm come
for you&mdash;but for <em>me</em>, Amîr Sahib blow me from gun
if Her Highness laugh while I there.”</p>

<p>I was considerably taken aback.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I was working down the chloral: I
had got fifteen grains less; but I couldn’t stop the
chillim.</p>

<p>There was no longer any necessity for me to live
in His Highness’s Pavilion, and he gave orders for
quarters to be prepared for me in the Prince’s quadrangle
near by, so that I could be on the spot in
case of necessity.</p>

<p>The room was curtained and carpeted, and wood
for the fire provided. My servants came to wait upon
me. An arm-chair of His Highness’s was sent, a table,
and candelabra. My friend, Shere Ali, came to see
me frequently; and the Page boys at all hours. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
visited the Amîr twice a day. Sometimes, he invited
me to sit on the very couch he was lying on, and
he told me many interesting stories of his adventures
in Russia.</p>

<p>For a few days His Highness continued about
the same. The albumen had nearly cleared away
(sp. gr. 1012), though crystals of lithic acid were
deposited, and occasional tube casts could be seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Relapse.</div>

<p>A day or two afterwards, His Highness had a
return of pain, and when I went to see him he said
that he felt weaker, and admitted that the Hakims
had overdone the form of treatment I spoke of.</p>

<p>The next day he was worse: the pains were more
severe; he had not slept, and he told me he had had
shivering and fever in the night.</p>

<p>The day after, the albumenuria returned, to the
extent, roughly, of a twelfth in the morning, and
later in the day a fifth (sp. gr. 1016). The left
ankle commenced swelling at five p.m., the pulse
was 100 and weak; Tr. 97·2.</p>

<p>Out of doors it was very cold. The snow had
commenced, and it was freezing hard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Concerning the Hindustani.</div>

<p>I thought of the Hindustani, and gnashed upon him:
for the Hakims had done much evil already, and I
thought they would surely complete their work.</p>

<p>“He has allowed his petty spite to place the life
of the Amîr in danger,” thought I; “to say nothing
of my life and that of the two Europeans here.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pyne had fortunately been able at this time
to obtain leave, and had departed for India with an
order for more machinery.</p>

<p>The idea occurred to me in a colloidal form that
perhaps I ought to destroy this Hindustani gnat. I
say “colloidal,” for I doubt if the idea would ever
have crystallized into action. When one has been long
trained in the art of saving life, killing does not come
readily. I fancy, however, I must have expressed the
idea aloud, for the Armenian said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir, you not kill it. You big man, he very small
man. Your wish, you can shoot Commander-in-Chief
or Dabier-ul-Mulk; you not kill two pice Hindustani&mdash;dog’s
son. Other small man catch it and kill it for you.”</p>

<p>The employment of assassins, however, did not
appeal to my imagination as a suitable line of action,
and I determined to await the course of events.</p>

<p>For some little time afterwards, if I heard much
commotion or bustle outside, I said to myself,</p>

<p>“The hour has come. The Amîr has joined his
fathers; now for the last fight.”</p>

<p>Then, again, I thought this over. What was the
good of fighting. Granted that my revolver gave me
six lives&mdash;why should I take six lives? It would not
save my own. And, query again: Was my life worth
six others? I rode to the workshops and discussed
the matter with the engineers, Stewart and Myddleton.
They were good fellows; but they did not agree with
me. They said they should make a fight for it; that
they were worth a good deal more than six Afghans.
Anyway, they did not mean to sit down and wait for
their throats to be cut like a couple of bullocks.</p>

<p>This <em>did</em> rather appeal to my imagination. There
was the fierce excitement and delight of battling for
one’s life, in place of the sickening emotion of waiting
to be murdered. I determined, therefore, to waive
the point as to whether my life were worth six others,
and discuss it afterwards if we escaped, which, by the
way, I did not think very likely. I did not so much
mind the idea of a bullet through the brain or heart&mdash;it
would be a momentary emotion; but a bayonet
stab&mdash;it does not kill at once; and a cut throat I
always had a horror of: I have seen so many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>Every night a dinner in European style was
brought me, and one day His Highness asked me if
I liked fruit. Forthwith, two large trays were brought
every night: one of fresh fruit&mdash;sweet lemons, grapes,
pomegranates, and apples; and one of dried fruits
and nuts, far more than any one person could eat;
and my servants had the benefit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sultana as a Hostess.</div>

<p>I continued attending the Sultana. She showed
me her crowns: they were heavy, of beaten gold,
worked in intricate designs, and lined with velvet.
One had ostrich plumes on it, another had common
artificial flowers tucked in round the top. I suggested
that flowers were unsuitable on a crown, and
Her Highness tore them out. She showed me her
hats and bonnets, handing them to me under the
curtain. Most of them were English, of an old-fashioned
shape. I said they were scarcely fit for a
Queen, but she said that the Amîr liked to see her
wear them. One was a fur cap&mdash;seal, I think&mdash;trimmed
with a sable tail. It was very pretty, but
artificial flowers had been added. I said that flowers
grew in the summer and fur was worn in the winter,
perhaps it would look better without the flowers.
Her Highness removed them at once. She showed
me a photograph album: it contained a few photographs:
among them was a copy of a painting of
Queen Catherine of Russia. It was a very beautiful
face, and the Sultana spoke in admiration of the
Queen.</p>

<p>Her Highness asked me to choose a photograph
and she would give it me. I had noticed hanging
on the wall of the room a photograph, framed in
wood, of His Highness the Amîr. I said that as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
had none of my Royal Master I should like that one, if
Her Highness could spare it. At once it was taken
down by one of the Page boys and handed to me.</p>

<p>The Sultana asked me if I knew the names of
the Princes, the sons of the Amîr. When I had
repeated them she asked me if I knew her own
name. I had imagined it was not correct for anyone,
not of the family, to know a lady’s name. I therefore
told Her Highness that, before me, she was spoken
of as “the Illustrious Lady.” She, however, told me
at once that her name was Halima, so that my
prevarication was unnecessary.</p>

<p>She showed me a star and a sword His Highness
the Amîr had given her. The Amîr was away fighting,
and a rebellion arose in Kabul; the young Sultana
at once issued from the Harem, veiled, took command
of the troops in Kabul, and quelled the rebellion.</p>

<p>The messenger Her Highness sent when she called
me was apparently a lad of fifteen or sixteen, called
Sirdar. I was informed that it was not a boy but a
girl. She was dressed in trousers, tunic, and turban,
and considered herself, as indeed did other people, a
man. It seemed a little odd to me at first when she
came to my room in the middle of the night to call
me to attend the Sultana, and coolly sat on the couch
while I dressed. I gave her a pair of braces. She had
to be on duty night and day, and was worn-looking
from insufficient sleep, and she threatened to box my
ears if I did not increase the dose of chloral I was
giving the Sultana: I had worked it down to forty
grains.</p>

<p>I told her I was afraid to increase the dose, as the
medicine was a deadly poison, and that its prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
use in large doses was productive of considerable
harm.</p>

<p>The Sultana, not knowing the danger of the
medicine, had learnt the habit from the Hindustani
medical attendant, who was my predecessor. This
man had managed, when he had acquired considerable
wealth, to escape from the country. The Amîr told
me he was an utter scoundrel:&mdash;which is possible.</p>

<p>The Sultana usually sent for me as soon as she
woke, about one or two o’clock in the early morning,
for the chloral apparently did not procure her more
than four or five hours’ sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Tea-cup and the Thermometer.</div>

<p>One night, after having as usual handed her the
clinical thermometer, I found, to my horror, that the
indicator marked a temperature of over 106 degrees
Fahr.!</p>

<p>I at once asked Her Highness to allow me to
examine the pulse. She passed her hand under the
curtain. It was cool, and the pulse was steady&mdash;seventy
beats a minute. There could be no fever with
that pulse. I looked at the Armenian, and he pointed
silently to the tea cup by my side. I heard some
smothered laughter behind the curtain, and the truth
flashed upon me. The thermometer had been dipped
for a moment in the hot tea&mdash;hence 106 degrees Fahr.</p>

<p>Concerning the sleeping draught, Her Highness
the Sultana never spoke to me, but Sirdar, her
messenger, urged upon me frequently the necessity of
increasing the dose, saying that Her Highness could
not sleep, and was becoming angry with me. I refused
to increase the dose of chloral, and endeavoured
to substitute other soporifics.</p>

<p>The result was, that after about a fortnight Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Highness refused European medical treatment. So
far from worrying me, this was an absolute relief to my
mind; for the position was not without its dangers.</p>

<p>A week after this came Christmas day. I gave
instructions to the Chief Cook, and then invited
Messrs. Stewart and Myddleton to dine with me
in my rooms at the Palace.</p>

<p>It was a clear sunny day; bitterly cold, with a
hard frost. My guests arrived on horseback about
six p.m., their servants bringing knives, forks, and
plates, cigars, and a bottle of whisky. I hadn’t such
a thing as whisky, but I produced with great pride a
quart bottle of champagne that I had found in the
medical stores, and which I had the Amîr’s permission
to use.</p>

<p>We sat down to dinner. My brass candelabra, each
with three candles, lit up the festive board: a wood
fire blazing on the hearth threw a warm glow over the
room: the white walls cast back the light; and the
cosy room, with crimson curtains drawn over door and
windows, made us almost forget Afghanistan, and we
lost, if only for a time, the feeling of insecurity in
which we were living.</p>

<p>We had soup, tinned salmon, partridges, roast
mutton, anchovy toast, plum pudding all blazing, and
fruit. Then came the champagne. With subdued but
proud excitement we cut the wire and waited for the
cork to pop&mdash;it did not pop. We eased it a little with
our thumb, and waited. We patted the bottle gently;
then shook it&mdash;and still waited. The Armenian,
standing by, smiled.</p>

<p>“You might bring a corkscrew,” I said, carelessly;
“the cork is evidently hard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>He produced a corkscrew with suspicious readiness,
and I proceeded to carefully insert it. Oh, yes,
the cork came out easily enough. It was not the
fault of the cork. But the champagne!&mdash;Did you
ever taste champagne that hadn’t any fizz in it?
It is beastly.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with it?” I asked the Armenian,
when he had tasted it.</p>

<p>“No-thing, Sir!” he said. “He in Hospital ’leven
years, all his strength gone away.”</p>

<p>We “passed” the champagne; whisky was good
enough for us.</p>

<p>I told the Armenian that it was only blue-blooded
Dukes like himself who could drink flat champagne.</p>

<p>“Sir, he is not flat; very good sherbet he is; I
like him.”</p>

<p>But after he had been to England he wouldn’t
drink champagne that had been eleven years in
the Hospital.</p>

<p>After dinner Myddleton sang with great taste,
and in a sweet tenor voice, some old English ballads&mdash;“The
Thorn,” “The Anchor’s Weighed,” and a
Christmas carol; Stewart occasionally putting in a
seconds. I enjoyed it immensely: it was such a
treat to hear music again. I did not sing myself,
for some of my servants were Afghans and they were
in the room: I should have lowered myself in their
eyes if I had sung; my guests, however, were indifferent
to the opinion of the Afghans.</p>

<p>About midnight they departed, and rode back,
escorted by a couple of soldiers, to their rooms at the
workshops.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Fainting Attack.</div>

<p>Two days after this His Highness had a fainting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
attack; at least he described it as such to me. He
said he had been so ill that it had been necessary
to give him wine to restore his senses. He desired
me to examine the wine and ascertain if it were
a suitable stimulant for him. A bottle was handed
to me and I poured some out into a wine-glass. It
was a clear amber-coloured liquid&mdash;may be Chablis, I
thought. I was about to drink it, when His Highness
said,</p>

<p>“Khubar dar!”&mdash;“Take care, it is strong;”
and he suggested my adding some sherbet.</p>

<p>“Chablis and sherbet!” I thought; “No, I am
not a Mahomedan,” and I smiled and tossed
it off.</p>

<p>Sword of Damocles! It was liquid fire!
I swallowed and swallowed and blinked and
gasped.</p>

<p>As expressing a rapid succession of complicated
emotions my face must have been a study, for the
Amîr leant back on his pillows and roared with
laughter. As soon as I could get my breath I
coughed out that it was a very bad wine and not
at all suitable for His Highness. It was Vodki, I
believe, or a Russian spirit of some sort&mdash;neat.</p>

<p>I went on to say that for the complaint His
Highness was suffering from, every kind of wine
was more or less harmful; but that, if faintness rendered
it necessary, the best he could drink would be
good old whisky. I knew that Pyne had brought a
supply to Kabul, and when he went away on leave,
he had let Stewart and Myddleton have the residue.
I therefore rode off to the shops to beg a bottle.
When I returned to the Palace, I placed it before His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
Highness, and explained how it should be taken:&mdash;One
ounce of whisky to two of water, or, in extreme
cases, in equal quantities. His Highness desired me
to show him how to take it. It was the first and only
“medicine” the Amîr asked me to taste before him.
I poured out an ounce, added two ounces of water,
and drank it. Then I sat down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect on the Physician.</div>

<p>Presently, I began to feel a little giddy; not that
I was uncomfortable&mdash;on the contrary; and it struck
me what a good thing it would be to tell the Amîr
an amusing story that I had suddenly thought of.
I remembered, however, in time that he did not
understand English, and thought that probably the
point would be lost, or at any rate blunted, if it
had to first penetrate an Interpreter’s head. And
then it occurred to me that Vodki, or whatever the
Russian abomination was, followed by a whisky peg,
was not a good thing for a Physician to drink, fasting.
I said to His Highness, that being unaccustomed
to Shrâb (alcohol), the doses I had taken were
beginning, I was afraid, to affect my wits: would he
allow me to withdraw.</p>

<p>“Be not disturbed,” His Highness said. “I can
cure you.”</p>

<p>He ordered a cup of strong tea, with a lemon
squeezed in it, and directed me to drink it at once.
It certainly did clear my head in a wonderful way.
By-and-bye, I got away to my room and went to
sleep in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>The Amîr approved of the whisky, and requested
me to write at once to Mr. Pyne to order three
casks. In due time they arrived.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards the Amîr had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
alarming head symptom. He described his feelings
when I went to see him. There was a sort of aura
passing from the feet to the head, buzzing in the
ears, headache, and a feeling of great heaviness in
the head. I was afraid the symptoms might be the
forerunners of an apoplectic, or some nervous seizure.
Happily, however, the head symptoms gradually subsided,
and two days afterwards the pain had returned
to the limbs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I had got to work again at the
Hospital. The severer cases had accumulated considerably,
and I had several surgical operations to
do. One was a Stone operation on a small boy,
which interested Prince Habibullah very much. The
boy got well very quickly, and I took him, with a
Workshop accident case that had recovered, to the
Durbar that the Prince was holding in the Salaam
Khana.</p>

<p>During the Amîr’s illness, Prince Habibullah had
relieved His Highness of a great deal of Governmental
work. Sitting for hours nearly every day,
he held Durbars and gave decisions in cases of dispute.
He was the Chief Civil Magistrate of the
town. Minor cases were decided by the “Kôtwal,”
or Chief of the Military Police of Kabul.</p>

<p>In addition to these Civil Magistracies there is
an Ecclesiastical Court, presided over by the Chief
Priest, the “Khân-i-Mullah Khan,” for the Priests
are those who are learned in the Mahomedan law.
There is always, however, the final right of appeal
to the Sovereign: though I have heard the Amîr
himself apply to the Khân-i-Mullah for instruction on
certain points of law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Duties of the Princes.</div>

<p>The duty of Prince Nasrullah was to superintend
the management of the Government offices, and the
work of the numerous scribes and secretaries&mdash;the
Mirzas. Both Princes worked hard, and one met
them in all weathers, in the blazing sun, in the
hissing icy winds, the heavy snow fall, or the pouring
rain, riding on their way from their houses in the
city to the Durbar Hall, or the Mirza’s offices, in the
Erg Palace. With their regular and daily attendance
upon their duties, they shamed many of
the high officials of the Kingdom, and were a
living and daily lesson to the ordinary Afghan,

<div class="sidenote">Hindustani Intrigue.</div>

<p>The interesting Hindustani whom I have designated
the “Gnat,” and who, by the way, was giving lessons
in English to Prince Habibullah, began to spread
reports in the bazaars concerning my personal
character. As, however, I had done nothing to
reproach myself with, I did not bother my head
about the matter, until one day the Secretary of the
British Agent, that highly-educated Mahomedan
I have spoken of, called upon me and told me the
nature of the rumours. Then I was more than a
little annoyed. It was so abominable. Only the
vile mind of this creature could have conceived the
indignity of charging me&mdash;not openly, but by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
whispered word here and there&mdash;with impurity.
What could I do? To attempt to defend myself
against a charge that was not formulated, that only
lived, like the typhus poison, in filthy corners&mdash;invisible&mdash;was
to accuse myself.</p>

<p>The Agent’s Secretary very kindly enquired
whether there were anything he could do that
could in any way give the lie to the rumours.</p>

<p>So far as I could see, the utmost that could be
done was to refuse absolutely to allow the man to
interpret or translate for me on any occasion whatsoever.
I said as much to the Agent’s Secretary,
and he advised me to write at once to the Amîr
and inform him of my decision.</p>

<p>I therefore wrote to His Highness, saying I did
not trust the man&mdash;though of course I had nothing
very definite to accuse him of; and I ended my letter
by saying that rather than have this man interpret for
me before His Highness, I would ask His Highness’
permission to leave his service.</p>

<p>Lest the Amîr might think I had been instigated
to write this letter by the Armenian, I asked the
Agent’s Secretary to translate it for me. His
Highness did not answer my letter in writing, but
whenever I was called before him the Hindustani
was not there.</p>

<p>Events in after years, however, showed me that
the Amîr <em>did</em> look upon the matter as a quarrel
between two Interpreters, an effort on the part of
each of them to trip the other up. He never knew
the discomfort and mental distress that I was compelled
to suffer.</p>

<p>The Hindustani then made another move. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
he worked it I do not know, but some weeks afterwards
I received a letter from Her Highness the
Sultana in which she desired me to again attend
her. I was, however, to bring the Hindustani to
interpret. I at once wrote to Her Highness
and refused; sending also a letter to the Amîr
acquainting him with the facts of the case. His
Highness answered that I might be accompanied
by another Interpreter if I wished. I informed the
Sultana of the Amîr’s decision, but, as might be
expected, she being a woman, I was not sent for&mdash;much
to my relief.</p>

<p>For some weeks His Highness appeared about the
same. He was better for a day or two, then worse
again. I visited him frequently, though I did not
prescribe for him. He sent, however, to Bombay for
certain medicines I thought suitable for his case.</p>

<p>One day, while I was there, little Prince Mahomed
Omer came to salaam his father, and the Amîr was
much amused at the authoritative way the Prince&mdash;he
was not yet two&mdash;ordered about the little boys by
whom he was surrounded. He frightened one of them
so much that the child began to cry. The Amîr
laughed, and gave the Prince an orange.</p>

<p>“The youngster has the manner of a King,” said
the Amîr.</p>

<p>One can only guess what the future may bring
forth. The past has shown us that when the great
Amîr, Dôst Mahomed, departed from this world he
deputed a younger son, Shere Ali, to succeed him,
and this because he was, on both mother and father’s
side, of Royal descent. The elder sons, not so happy,
were passed over. The successes and reverses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
Shere Ali, in his contests with his brothers, is an old
story.</p>

<p>So far as I know, Amîr Abdurrahman has never
openly said whom he would wish to succeed him. I
think, however, there are many indications leading
one to infer that if His Highness continue to reign for
another ten years, Prince Mahomed Omer will be
looked upon as the heir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Two Factions.</div>

<p>There are in Kabul at the present time two distinct
and opposing factions: that of the Sultana for her
son’s sake, and that of Prince Habibullah.</p>

<p>Much as I desired to avoid being drawn into
intrigue or any appearance of being attached to either
party&mdash;for the matter was of no possible interest to
me&mdash;I know I was looked upon as belonging to the
Sultana’s party, chiefly, I believe, because of my
dislike to the Hindustani “Gnat,” who belonged to
the opposing faction. Nevertheless, Prince Habibullah
was always most courteous and kind.</p>

<p>The Sultana had a very powerful following. She
is the “favourite” wife, and is most liberal and
generous to those with whom she comes in contact.
She is of the same blood as the Amîr, and is not unlike
him in decision and strength of character.</p>

<p>Habibullah is a man of ability, kindly and genial,
but his mother was the handmaiden to one of the
Queens (daughter of the Mîr of Badakshan), who,
having no children, said, “Go in unto my maid, that
I may have children by her.” Habibullah cannot sit
in the presence of this Queen without permission: a
fact which weighs with Afghan people.</p>

<p>I do not know what line the Indian Government
would take; but the probabilities are that when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
eventful moment arrives the matter will be decided
before ever the British could reach Kabul. Judging
by the past, I imagine the principals of one party or
other would, before many days were over, be in jail,
or otherwise <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Should the Amîr live till the little Prince
attain adult age and the Prince fulfil the promise of
his childhood, I imagine he would hold the throne
alone. He is of the type of his father. Habibullah,
with the moral support of an English Resident ostensibly
keeping in the background, would, I take it, rule
wisely. A Resident, I think, would not need a large
escort, for a man of tact would be the friend, not the
rival, of the King; and the Afghans are now accustomed
to the presence of Feringhis in their midst. However,
I am talking of things that do not concern me.</p>

<p>At the end of January I asked permission to move
from my quarters in the Palace and return to my
house in the city. I saw more of the English engineers,
Stewart and Myddleton, at this time, and it was
infinitely refreshing to live again in an atmosphere of
wholesome English ideas, rather than breathe the air
of an Oriental Court reeking with intrigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Divers Discomforts.</div>

<p>Though I had my house to myself, and was not liable
to be intruded upon at all hours of the day by the Page
boys and Chamberlains, there were, nevertheless, I
found, certain bodily discomforts and inconveniences
to undergo, arising chiefly from the intense cold.
Owing to the numerous doors and windows in the
house, there was not a room that we could keep the
bitter wind out of. I had been called to the Palace in
the early winter, and had only a small stock of wood in
my house. This was soon gone, and now wood was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
scarce and hard to get, for the Royal workshops had
the first claim. The only way, therefore, to keep
warm was to sit crouched on the floor close up to the
charcoal sandali, and draw the quilt up to one’s chin,
wearing, at the same time, postîn, overcoat, and hat.
After several hours this becomes monotonous. In
order to hold a book and read, or at meal times to use
one’s knife and fork, it was necessary to protect the
hands with thick woollen gloves. One day, in
February, the weather struck me as being warmer
than usual, and I found the temperature in my sitting-room
had gone up to 20 degrees Fahr. This was not so
bad, and my thermometer would register it; but when
it was really cold, I was not able to find what the
temperature was, for the mercury shrank into the bulb.</p>

<p>At dinner time it is exceedingly inconvenient to
find you can neither break nor cut your bread: and
to be obliged to break up your drinking water with a
hammer is irritating. There is, I have heard, a large
trade in frozen meat between England and New
Zealand, and in this country I have eaten the
erstwhile frozen sheep with great enjoyment. In
Kabul it was not so. The joint came smoking from
the fire, brought in over a pan of charcoal, but the
centre, near the bone, was icy and raw: this was not
nice. Frozen pickles are useless: and the same may
be said of frozen ink: my letters, therefore, were
written in pencil. Why the damson jam should not
have advanced beyond the glutinous stage of freezing,
I do not know, but it never froze solid. This worried
me at the time: there seemed something unnatural
about it. I dislike being hurried, and to be obliged to
drink my morning cup of cocoa at once to prevent it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
freezing, almost made me regret my rooms at the
Palace&mdash;Pages, atmosphere of intrigue and all: but
I overcame this weakness.</p>

<p>Going to bed was a function; and I dressed
carefully for the purpose. Over the woollens came a
tennis coat and a sheepskin waistcoat; there were two
pairs of wool socks, a dressing-gown, a pair of gloves,
and a hat. The cotton wool mattress was laid on the
earth-beaten floor: it was warmer than a charpoy&mdash;but
harder. A buffalo rug, a fox-skin rug, and a quilt
finished the arrangements. One of the soldiers of the
guard had to come and put my candle out when the
performance was over.</p>

<p>I do not know how many people died of cold, but
there were a good many among the poorest. Going
to the Hospital I used often to see a beggar boy of
about fourteen lying naked on the snow monotonously
droning,</p>

<p>“Az baraï Khuda, yak ticca nân bidde!”&mdash;“For
the sake of God, one piece of bread give me!”</p>

<p>I was told he had gone about naked all his life.
I missed him one day, and thought he must be frozen
to death; but, no, I saw him again a year or two
afterwards. Though he lay on the snow, he always
chose a place sheltered from the wind, and where
the sun was shining brightly.</p>

<p>There was an unusually heavy snowfall that winter,
and the Amîr gave orders to remove the old brick
bridge over the Kabul river. The bridge was very
solidly built, and was said to be two hundred years
old. It was situated below the mountain gorge, and
just outside the workshops. His Highness considered
that when the snows were melting, the great volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
of water checked at the bridge piers would overflow
the workshops and swamp part of the town.
Future events proved the accuracy of the Amîr’s
prognostication.</p>

<p>In the workshops the engineers had the greatest
trouble to keep the steam up. Dry wood could not
be got, and with wet wood the fires could not be kept
going. The pipes carrying the water supply to the
boiler were constantly freezing solid, and at last work
with steam machinery came to a standstill.</p>

<p>My visits to the Amîr continued. His manner was
exceedingly kind. He described his symptoms daily,
and frequently spoke of again placing himself under
my care. He promised me leave of absence, and said
many other things that were very pleasant to hear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Question of “Bleeding.”</div>

<p>The Hakims, however, bled him again and again,
and his recovery was exceedingly tedious. I explained
to His Highness how harmful bleeding was in Gout,
and advised him not to be bled again: His Highness
was displeased with me. Some days afterwards,
however, he informed me that the Indian, English, and
Russian newspapers, in commenting upon his case,
had expressed views in regard to bleeding in
harmony with mine. He has been bled many times
since then.</p>

<p>Towards the end of February the cold began to
break. I did not see any skating during the winter,
so that as Kabul is the capital of the country, I doubt
if this is a sport among the Afghans. Not realizing
that cold in that country is so intense, I had left my
skates in England, otherwise I would have astonished
the natives. I have no doubt about that, although I
cannot skate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 1st of March the Amîr disbanded a regiment
of Shiah Mahomedans: he himself is a Sûnni.
This created a good deal of sensation in Kabul at the
time, for there is one part of the town, Chindawal,
devoted to Shiahs, though the majority of Afghans
are Sûnnis.</p>

<p>Two days afterwards I heard there was some
trouble at the Palace. I do not know all the details,
for, as I said, news from the Palace filters out slowly
and imperfectly. The Amîr was depressed, I take it,
by his long and tedious illness, for he called his sons
to him and told them that he had only some ten
years to live; and that in all probability neither Habibullah
nor any other of his sons would succeed him.
Ishak, on the one hand, and Ayoub on the other,
were candidates for the Throne, and it behoved the
Princes, his sons, to be amicable one towards the
other: a bundle of branches bound together was
strong, but taken separately they could be easily
broken.</p>

<p>The sun began to grow powerful, and the snow
melted rapidly. Fires and the sandali became
unnecessary; one had only to sit in the sun if one
felt the cold.</p>

<p>On March the 10th it was comparatively warm.
As it was my birthday, I went in the afternoon
to the Palace to visit the Amîr. His Highness
was at dinner. He sent me some grapes, and I
sat in one of the side rooms, or alcoves, and waited.
After dinner I talked to His Highness. He told me
he was better, and could walk a little. He was not so
thin as he had been. After talking to me for some
time, he ordered a beautiful little Kataghani horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
brown with black points, to be brought from the
stables, and asked me to accept it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sabbath: the Amîr’s Decision.</div>

<p>Shortly after this, the interesting Hindustani Interpreter&mdash;the Gnat&mdash;endeavoured
to prejudice the
two English engineers, Stewart and Myddleton, in His
Highness’s eyes. He reported to Sirdar Usuf Khan,
the Amîr’s uncle, who, nominally, superintended the
workshops, that the Englishmen, though Christians,
did no work on Friday. He being the only Interpreter
they had, they rode to my house one evening
to inform me. I directed the Armenian to write to
His Highness and explain that the Engineers had
given up <em>their</em> Sabbath to His Highness’s service;
had His Highness any objection to their keeping the
Mahomedan Sabbath instead of their own.</p>

<p>The Amîr answered that he had not the slightest
objection; and he wrote to the Sirdar that it was folly
to expect the men to work every day in the week.
The Sirdar was a courtly old gentleman, but in the
Shops there were constant frictions. He no more
understood the nature of an English workman than
he understood Physiology or any other Science. I
think Sir Salter&mdash;then Mr.&mdash;Pyne was also somewhat
of a puzzle to him. Pyne has strong characteristics
and decided views, and the Sirdar Sahib had not the
former, though he assumed the latter, and on a subject
in which he was but ill informed.</p>

<p>When the thaw commenced, the Engineers endeavoured
to make up for time lost during the frost
by frequently working all night. There was a certain
amount of work to be got through by the Mahomedan
New Year’s Day, in order that a good show of arms
and ammunition could be laid before the Amîr.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>The last day of the old year was a Friday, and the
holidays began then. At the foot of the Asmai
mountains horse-racing and sports were held. Crowds
of spectators lined the road, and the Grand Stand
was the grey, old, rocky mountain: he had put on his
holiday garb; all the lower half was crowded with
gaily-dressed Afghans, sitting or standing in thousands
in the blazing sun.</p>

<p>For the Princes and richer men tents were erected
on any sufficiently level rock, and the servants, lighting
a wood fire near, served them with tea, and cakes, and
sweetmeats. For the poorer people there were itinerant
cake merchants, sweetmeat vendors, and the Sakabi,
with his water-skin and wooden cup; and for those
who could afford it, there was iced sherbet&mdash;lemon,
orange, or rose, in tumblers. There were toy sellers,
too, with paper flags, whistles, and cheap walking-sticks
from India; these were bought by the crowds
who thronged the streets on their way to the
mountain.</p>

<p>The horse-racing, over a course some five hundred
yards in length, more or less, according to the fancy
of the riders, and on a hard road, was, compared with
what we call horse-racing, somewhat of a caricature.
There were no prizes and no starters: anybody
could gallop up and down the road who wished. As
many did wish, and as there was no sort of order
and much reckless riding, collisions were frequent.
Sometimes, a horse and rider would be sent spinning.
I do not know if there were many breakages, I did
not go and see: I concluded they would fetch me if
they wanted me. One considerable smash occurred
just opposite where I was, and the friends came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
gathered up the fragments that remained. They threw
water in the face of the riding fragment, and he
presently recovered: the ridden fragment limped
painfully away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tent-pegging: Lemon Slicing.</div>

<p>There was “tent-pegging,” or something in a
sense equivalent. There was no tent-peg, but a
boy’s cap was put on the ground, and the soldiers
charged at it with lances. The owner of the cap
was not distressed mentally: his cap was fairly
safe. The riders were very skilful in scoring the
ground near, but only one or two touched the cap,
and then a murmur went up from the spectators.
The way the small Afghan boys gathered near to
see the sport was rather horrifying: I fully expected
to see one skewered: however, it was not so written
in the book of Fate.</p>

<p>There was also “lemon-slicing.” A lemon was
stuck on the end of a rod, which was planted upright
in the ground. The soldiers dashed up one
after another, flourishing their sabres, and looking
very fierce and terrible; but they did not often hurt
the lemon.</p>

<p>Occasionally, some man of position would join in.
These were, as a rule, more skilful with both lance
and sword than the soldiers were: possibly, they
devoted more time to practice. My Turkestan friend,
the Mirza Abdur Rashid, rode in: he was not at all
unskilful with the lance. I saw, though not on this
occasion, the Sirdar Abdul Kudus Khan, son of the
Amîr’s cousin, and Naim Khan, the Courtier, tent-pegging
and shooting at a mark while going full
gallop: they were exceedingly skilful.</p>

<p>My small friend, Mahomed Omer, son of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
Deputy Commander-in-Chief, rode in on a little
white Arab. He was about thirteen, but he must
have practised considerably, for he picked up the
cap on his lance the first try.</p>

<p>The small boy who accompanied Prince Nasrullah
on his visit to England this year, was the younger
brother of Mahomed Omer. He had grown so, that
I did not recognize him on the platform at Victoria,
when the Prince arrived, until he came up and spoke
to me.</p>

<p>There were displays of horsemanship: standing
on the saddle and holding on to the reins, with the
horse at full gallop; picking up a handkerchief from
the ground while at a gallop, and so on: however,
there was nothing but what I had seen done in
England, and with greater skill. I had imagined
that the Afghans were born riders, skilful swordsmen,
and deadly shots; but whatever the hillmen,
as a class, may be, the soldiers certainly are not
remarkable.</p>

<p>The Princes were at the “tomasha,” but His
Highness the Amîr was, of course, unable to honour
the sports by his presence. I was told, indeed,
that he now very rarely does so; and the result
has been that the sports have fallen off considerably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Year Congratulations.</div>

<p>The next day was “Naû Roz,” or the New Year’s
Day. I was informed that His Highness would be
able to receive me at three p.m. In the morning,
therefore, I rode to the Babur Badshah Gardens
to salaam the Sultana, who was staying in the Bungalow
there. On the way I met Mahomed Omer and
complimented him on his skill with the lance. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
is a bright little fellow, and he seemed greatly pleased
at being complimented. He was gorgeous in scarlet
and gold, and was at the head of a troop of cavalry,
in his exalted post of “Commander-in-Chief” to
Prince Mahomed Omer.</p>

<p>At the gardens we had tea and cigarettes in a
tent while our congratulations were taken in to the
Sultana. I did not, of course, see Her Highness,
and she sent the New Year greetings by her messenger,
“Sirdar”&mdash;the girl-boy.</p>

<p>By the time we had returned to Kabul it was
three o’clock, and I rode on to the Palace.</p>

<p>When I arrived His Highness was being conveyed
in a palanquin to the Salaam Khana, where there were
arranged for his inspection, rifles, sabres, cartridges,
sword-sticks, rupees, and other productions of the
workshops.</p>

<p>His Highness was kind enough to stop and
enquire how I was. He evidently remembered&mdash;as
I did&mdash;that at the last big reception of this kind <em>I</em>
had been the invalid, for he asked if I had had any
return of the illness. I was happy to tell him I
was well, and that my greatest wish was that he
might soon be the same. While His Highness was
speaking. Col. Attaullah Khan, the British Agent,
came and stood near me; by the side of such a
splendid man I felt a stripling, for I am but a
meagre six feet with my boots on.</p>

<p>When the inspection of arms was over, His
Highness, followed by the Princes and the Courtiers,
entered the Salaam Khana and took his seat on the
couch in one of the end rooms. He kindly allowed
me to be seated, though everyone else stood, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
taking some cigars from a box he sent them to me
by a Page boy, and invited me to smoke.</p>

<p>Presently, the Maleks, and Merchants, and others,
who wished to make New Year’s offerings, were
admitted. They stood just inside the doorway, and
round the lower end of the room. The Court
attendants took the presents and laid them on the
ground in front of the Amîr.</p>

<p>There were rolls of silks and satins; lamps,
musical-boxes, Russian boots, vases, Japanese cabinets,
sugar, sweets, inexpensive writing-cases, pocket-knives,
flowers, and in the midst of the medley I
noticed a pair of trouser stretchers.</p>

<p>His Highness did not seem very much interested
in the presents, though Prince Habibullah occasionally
took up an article and examined it.</p>

<p>When the offering of presents was completed,
chairs were brought for the Princes and they sat
down. Why I should have been allowed to sit while
the Princes stood, I do not know, unless it were, as
I sometimes thought, that the Amîr wished to guard
the Princes from the danger of acquiring a too exalted
notion of their own personal importance.</p>

<p>Prince Habibullah was always courteous, and
struck me as having much more <i>savoir vivre</i> than
Prince Nasrullah.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“White-beard;” His Age.</div>

<p>At five p.m. Messrs. Stewart and Myddleton were
received by His Highness. Chairs were placed for
them and tea was brought. After the usual polite
salutations His Highness asked Stewart how old he
was. The question, no doubt, was suggested to the
Amîr’s mind by the fact that Stewart’s hair and beard
were silvery white. Afghans, when their hair turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
grey, almost invariably, unless they are Priests, dye it
black or red. His Highness’s hair and beard were
very grey when he was ill, but were blue-black afterwards,
and I could not help connecting this remarkable
fact with the many bottles of hair-dye I saw in the
stores.</p>

<p>His Highness was surprised to hear that Stewart
was only forty-eight. He laughed when he heard it,
and said he thought he must be a hundred.</p>

<p>After we had drunk tea permission was given us
to withdraw, and we rode home. During the reception
the Armenian had translated. Waiting outside and
expecting to be sent for, was the Hindustani, but
though Prince Habibullah asked where he was, no one
answered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="smaller smcap">A Kabul Spring.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The holidays lasted a week. The sports were continued
at Asmai, and in the evening fireworks were let
off in the town.</p>

<p>Whatever the weather may be, postîns and winter
clothing are never left off till Naû Roz, and never
continued afterwards. The weather, however, in
Afghanistan behaves more according to rule and is
less eccentric than in England. I became clothed in
a tunic of camel’s hair and a leather belt. Around
the brow the awe-inspiring turban was wreathed in
many folds&mdash;heavy but picturesque and protecting.
The camel-hair cloth was given me by a grateful
Afghan because I cut off his little son’s toe. He also
gave me two ancient China bowls. These were intelligent
articles, for if at any time food should be put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
them containing poison they would at once break
themselves into a thousand pieces&mdash;at least, so I was
informed; I did not, however, put the bowls to the
inconvenience of exhibiting their power of discernment,
for it seemed better to keep them as they were
than to take them home in a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>At this time I found that the Engineers had got a
book, and I borrowed it, having had nothing new to
read for many months. The book was that ancient
and gruesome collection of stories called “The Night
Side of Nature.” The narratives in it were similar to
those that the <cite>Review of Reviews</cite> laid before Seekers
after Truth, under the title of “Real Ghost Stories.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Haunted House.</div>

<p>It was a dreadful book. Read it alone in the
haunted wing of a house, and in a town full of the
memory of murders and midnight assassins; where
in the dead silence of the night unaccountable noises
force themselves upon the startled ear; and see how
you like it.</p>

<p>I knew my house was haunted, because I had
been told so.</p>

<p>One evening, absorbed in reading, I became
conscious that the windows rattled, a door slammed,
and suddenly, right over my head, there was a sound
as of a heavy body rolling rapidly along; and a
horrible shriek split the air. The awe-inspiring
volume slipped from the nerveless fingers (anatomically
this is not accurate), and palpitating with a
wordless horror, I sat powerless. For a long minute
all was still: then the sound as of stealthy footsteps
struck on the straining ear&mdash;on the tympanic membrane
as a matter of fact. The door moved slowly
on its creaking hinge, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>“Kîst!” “who is it!” rang in my ears.</p>

<p>It was my own voice, hoarse and unrecognizable,
uttering the cry. I clutched the ready revolver and
cocked it.</p>

<p>“Sahib! dead man, all is buried in garden. His
bones me see.”</p>

<p>It was my Indian cook who brought the information.
This, then, was the cause of the unnatural
manifestations. Doubtless, the house had been the
scene of a horrible murder, and the criminals had
hastily hidden the ghastly proof of their deed in
the garden; but murder will out, and the unrestful
spirit of the victim was wandering around.</p>

<p>Now I had studied Forensic Medicine and had
read Gaboriau. It behoved me, therefore, to work
out this crime, track the murderers, and bring them
to justice.</p>

<p>“Ustughonha biya inja,”&mdash;“Bring hither the
bones,” I said.</p>

<p>I know the human bones, every ridge, furrow,
and knob, from the fifth Metatarsal to the Sphenoid.
Many a night in the years gone by had I sat poring
over a bone, while the stars twinkled in the heavens&mdash;at
least, I expect they did; not that it matters.</p>

<p>The servant returned, and with horror and disgust
depicted on his swarthy face laid a small bone on the
table in front of me.</p>

<p>“But where are the others? Bring the skull,
man&mdash;the head.”</p>

<p>“Sahib, other me not see.”</p>

<p>With an eagle glance I pierced him, and he
shrunk back.</p>

<p>“Drivelling idiot, son of uncleanness, scoundrel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
whose heart is blacker than his face&mdash;this is not a
man’s bone. Bring me human bones.”</p>

<p>“Sahib, other me not got.”</p>

<p>“Get some, then, and at once;” and he fled from
the room.</p>

<p>Was I to be trifled with in this way; to be
made small and of no account? I was prepared
to unravel the mystery, and was I to be turned
aside by a servant&mdash;an Indian servant&mdash;a black
Indian servant?</p>

<p>But I cooled down afterwards, and by-and-bye,
when he came in to enquire if I wanted anything,
I said, No! he could go to bed.</p>

<p>In April, the weather was beautiful, sunny and
bright, without being too hot. The number of
patients coming to the Hospital increased as travelling
became easier. I saw about a hundred and
thirty cases daily. Some came great distances&mdash;from
Turkestan, Kandahar, Herat, and the borders of
Kaffristan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Called to the Palace.</div>

<p>On the 5th of April, His Highness sent word
that he wished to see me. When I arrived at the
Palace I found His Highness alone, but for one
Secretary and the Page boys. He looked much
better and stronger than he had done for a long
time. He was attired in native costume, in a bright
coloured silk robe, a small white turban wound
round a gold-embroidered cap, and loose white
Oriental pyjamas.</p>

<p>I stopped some distance from the couch and
bowed: His Highness beckoned me to a chair
near him and enquired if I were well. Then he
continued reading a letter the Secretary had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
written, and cigarettes were brought me. It seemed a
pity to smoke, for the air of the Palace was sweet
with the scent of freshly-cut flowers, hyacinths,
wallflowers, and narcissi.</p>

<p>Suddenly, His Highness looked up and asked me
when I should like to start for England: he said the
weather would soon be hot and unsuitable for travelling
in India; and before long, storms at sea were
to be feared.</p>

<p>I replied that I was awaiting His Highness’s
orders. He asked me how long leave I should like;
and when I said I left that entirely to him, he enquired
whether six months would be sufficient.</p>

<p>His Highness said also, that he would let me
know before my return in what part of the country
he was to be found, whether in Herat, Kandahar,
Turkestan, or Kabul, so that I could join him. He
desired me to draw the plans of a house such as I
should like to live in, and he would build it for me.</p>

<p>If my wife, after I were married, wished to return
with me, he should be pleased; and should she after
some months find the climate uncongenial, his permission
would be granted her to return to England.
Should she, however, prefer to remain in England,
leave of absence would be granted me every two years.
His Highness also told me many interesting things:
among them the reason why Afghanistan is poverty-stricken
and powerless, and he sketched methods in
which the resources of the country might be developed
if only his people had sense enough to follow out his
directions; but, as he said, there were so few he
could trust.</p>

<p>This very man before him, the Secretary, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
not be trusted even to write a letter correctly; and
yet, he said, this man and his brother were secretaries
to Amîr Shere Ali; and more, they had the keeping
of the King’s Signet. Why, therefore, with such men
in power, should not the country have become weak,
poverty-stricken, and on the verge of ruin!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Geologists in the Service.</div>

<p>One of his designs, he told me, was to again
employ an English geologist, and when the presence
of valuable minerals was made known, to open up
roads and start mining operations.</p>

<p>His Highness’s words were words of wisdom:
but looking back, as I do, with a knowledge of the
past, I am greatly in doubt as to whether the nature
of the Oriental will allow to any European geologist
in the Amîr’s service anything like a fair chance of
success in his endeavours. From the outset his good
faith is doubted. I heard from Captain Griesbach,
C.I.E., how hampered he had been on every hand;
how impossible it was made for him to do any useful
work; for the whisper had been spread&mdash;even I heard
it&mdash;that he carried a note-book, and if he found a
mineral of value it was not the Amîr to whom the
fact was reported, but the British Government. Disgusted
that his efforts should be so curtailed and
his powers made useless, the Captain left the service.</p>

<p>The next geologist who entered the service was
Mr. Arthur Collins, F.G.S., who was recommended
to the Amîr’s Agent by the Home Office. His
experiences were very similar to those of Captain
Griesbach. He was followed about rigorously by
a guard, and from whatever place he took a specimen,
from the same place an official in his ignorance
took what he considered to be a similar specimen:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
this was to act as a check on the geologist! After
a few months Mr. Collins, new to the country,
photographed some interesting geological formations
that he saw. At once it was reported that the
new geologist was a political agent spying out the
nakedness of the land. He was recalled to Kabul
and kept, as Captain Griesbach had been, for
months doing nothing, till, in disgust, he also resigned.
Whether any other able man will in the
future consider it other than waste of time to work
against such obstacles&mdash;petty, intangible, but real&mdash;I
know not. The game seems hardly worth the
candle: unless, indeed, one thinks fit to descend
and meet the Oriental on his own ground: to
employ bribery; or, having learnt the language, to
indulge in intrigue and trip his enemies one by one:&mdash;not
a difficult matter&mdash;for that any educated
Englishman of ordinary intelligence is a match for
an Afghan or Hindustani I have not a doubt, granted
that he cares to employ his brain in such unclean
work. Pitch, however, is proverbially defiling,
and the triumph is lost if one comes out of a game
besmeared.</p>

<p>His Highness desired me to inform him as soon
as I had finished the arrangements I wished to make
at the Hospital to enable the Hindustani assistants
to carry on the work during my absence; then I
was to start on my journey home. He said many
kind things to me; among others, that he considered
me a man worthy of trust. He added that
there were certain orders he should commission me
to execute in London.</p>

<p>These, I found, were to be the sending out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
materials&mdash;silks, satins, and cloth; and jewellery of
various kinds. My education, however, having been
medical, I was not in any sense a business man, and
it occurred to me that this was a suitable opportunity
for acceding to the Armenian’s request, and
taking him to London with me: he could attend to
these matters better than I.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Locusts.</div>

<p>A few days afterwards, therefore, I wrote to His
Highness, and asked permission for the Armenian to
accompany me to England. His Highness granted
my request, and, when the time arrived, generously
gave the Armenian two thousand rupees to pay his
expenses.</p>

<p>We did not, however, start on the journey so soon
as I had expected, for His Highness desired me to
paint his portrait again. Accordingly, a few days
afterwards I went to the Palace, but I found on
examination that His Highness had not recovered
strength sufficiently to enable him to undergo the
fatigue of sitting for a portrait. This seemed likely
to put a stop to my home going for an indefinite time;
until a thought struck me&mdash;why should not I paint a
portrait from the photograph that the Sultana had
given me. I said nothing to His Highness, but
set to work.</p>

<p>While I was working at this portrait I saw some
extraordinary clouds come quivering along just above
the tree tops. They seemed almost as though they
were made up of myriads of little birds. I learnt
what they were soon enough. The locusts had come.
The year before I had seen in Turkestan swarms of
little black birds, the only birds, they told me, that
feed on locusts. The Amîr had made an order that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
all who killed these birds were to be fined. As, however,
they had a habit of devouring mulberries as well
as locusts, many of them were killed. Curiously
enough the locusts did not settle in Kabul, though on
the outskirts of the town one occasionally saw a tree
leafless. They came from the direction of Peshawur,
and at Jelalabad and other places on the way they had
worked havoc.</p>

<p>Towards the end of April the portrait was
finished, and I went to the Palace to lay it before the
Amîr.</p>

<p>Entering the Palace gardens I met little Prince
Mahomed Omer riding out on horseback surrounded
by his guard, with his Lâla or Tutor walking by his
side. He looked very dignified and proud as he
sat his horse alone. The Lâla whispered to him,
and he answered my bow by touching his cap: he was
a year and eight months old. When I reached the
Palace His Highness sent a Page to conduct me to
one of the gardens where he said he should be sitting
very shortly.</p>

<p>We went through a passage under the wall of the
fort, across the moat, and round to the gardens on the
west side of the Palace. There were several tents
erected, but the Amîr’s, which was a gorgeous one,
lined with crimson and white, with glass doors, was
pitched on a circular piece of ground, surrounded
by a narrow artificial stream, edged with Pampas
grass. The circular stream was fed by a perfectly
straight stream, edged thickly with Pampas grass, and
the water flowed away by a similar stream on the
right. All around were flower-beds and trees, and in
the distance, to the west, the Paghman Mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
capped with snow. Behind was the Palace. In front
of the Amîr’s tent a large awning was stretched.</p>

<p>Here on the carpets the Chief Officers of the army
were seated chatting together. Crossing the stream by
a little bridge, I joined them, and a chair was brought.
For the Amîr, was an arm-chair covered with blue
velvet and old gold coloured satin, and in front
of it a tiger skin footrug. Out in the garden two
or three hundred soldiers were drawn up: it was
a military Durbar.</p>

<p>Presently the Officers jumped up and joined the
soldiers, and I found the Amîr was approaching.
He came in a palanquin with a guard of soldiers,
and in front marched the Page boys, each armed
with a small rifle. His Highness was dressed in a
grey military uniform embroidered with gold, and
a grey astrakhan hat with a diamond star. He looked
very handsome, but rather pale.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amîr’s Thoughtfulness.</div>

<p>When His Highness drew near I stood up and
took off my turban:&mdash;this is not a difficult matter, one
seizes the top of the conical cap round which the
turban is tightly wound. The Armenian who was
with me said, “Salaam aleikoum,” and when His
Highness looked up I bowed. He asked me how I
was, and then descending from the palanquin he
walked slowly to the chair. I was very glad to see
him walking again. It was a cloudy and windy day,
and presently His Highness turned to me and desired
me to cover my head lest I took cold.</p>

<p>Then the portrait I had just painted was brought
forward for His Highness to see. He was pleased
with it, and surprised that I should have painted it
without a sitting. He told me it required certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
alterations, chiefly in the colouring, and he gave
directions for the portrait I had painted in Turkestan
to be taken down from the Palace and brought to
my house to correct this one by;</p>

<p>“For,” said he, “that is an exact likeness.”</p>

<p>I was at the Durbar about three hours, and His
Highness told me many things; among others was
this:&mdash;There were out in the garden several
companies of soldiers drawn up before him, young
men and lads, perhaps, 300. Of these there were
about twenty of whom he wished to make officers.
He said:</p>

<p>“These men are gentlemen; their fathers and their
grandfathers were gentlemen and men of position,
but such is the ignorance of the people I govern that
not one of them can read or write: they know
nothing. What work can they do? None. They can
quarrel and fight; it is all they are fit for.”</p>

<p>He told me that he had given orders for them
to be taught, so that they would be able, at least,
to write and read a letter.</p>

<p>He had a regiment of boy soldiers&mdash;the
“Mahomedan Regiment,” these also he had directed
to be taught reading and writing.</p>

<p>One incident occurred which may be interesting:</p>

<p>A soldier of the guard, a man whom I had
attended in Mazar, a handsome fellow who seemed
to be always laughing, came up to His Highness to
report an arrest he had made. He said that while
he was on guard over His Highness’s tent an
intruder approached and he challenged him. No
answer being returned he tried to persuade him
to go away, saying:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sahib, this is Amîr Sahib’s tent; the tent of
the great King; come not here I pray you.”</p>

<p>But the intruder, treating him with silent
contempt, advanced. Once more he tried persuasion.
Humbly taking off his turban he implored:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sahib! Barai-i-Khuda! For God’s sake,
approach no nearer; it is Amîr Sahib’s tent.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrest.</div>

<p>This last request being no more effective than
the other, he determined to act boldly and arrest the
intruder be he whom he might. Throwing down
his rifle he pounced upon him, overpowered him,
and then proceeded to make him fast. Driving
four tent pegs into the ground he fastened his legs
to two of the pegs and his head to the other two&mdash;in
the manner that unruly horses are fixed in
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>He felt he had done his duty, and taking up his
rifle he continued his march in front of the tent.
But, wai, wai! that he should have to tell it, when
his back was turned, up came two of the gardeners
and murdered the prisoner as he lay.</p>

<p>“Ah?” said the Amîr, with a gleam in his eye;
“bring hither the body.”</p>

<p>The soldier withdrew, and presently returned
bearing the body of the victim. It was a little
mouse.</p>

<p>The Amîr looked at the soldier a moment and
then burst into a hearty laugh. Everyone joined
in&mdash;except the gardeners. They were called up&mdash;forty
of them&mdash;and after being reprimanded for
allowing mice in the garden, were ordered each of
them to pay a fine of a certain number of mice
every year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day when the Turkestan portrait
arrived I set to work to correct the new one
by it; and when that was finished I copied the
first, since His Highness approved of it, on another
canvas.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May, when both were completed,
I took them to the Palace. Hearing, however,
that His Highness was not sitting, I was coming
away, when he sent for me back again. He was much
pleased with the paintings, and taking a cigarette
out of his case he fitted it in a holder and gave it
me to smoke. He also said he should be greatly
pleased if I would paint a portrait of the two eldest
Princes before I left. I said that nothing would
give me greater pleasure: but afterwards, on thinking
it over, my remark struck me as being somewhat
beyond the truth.</p>

<p>It was the month of Ramazàn, the yearly Mahomedan
fast. The Prince could not sit fasting:
Religion would not allow him to eat in the day
time; and my capabilities would not allow me to
paint in the night, and we were at a standstill.
Instead of sitting for his portrait, therefore, the
Prince took unto himself another wife, and invited
me to the wedding. I have described the Reception
after the wedding, in an early part of the narrative.</p>

<p>On May 9th the Fast of Ramazàn ended, and on
the 10th was the festival of Îd. It was a bright
sunny day, which, after the most unusual storms of
hail and rain we had been having, was delightful.
The hailstones of the day before were as big
as the end of one’s finger&mdash;I brought some in to
examine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span></p>

<p>In the night, the river, which, owing to the melting
snows and the rain had been rapidly rising,
became so swollen as to be a source of no little
danger to a part of the town. Fortunately the
bridge had been almost cleared away, but as it was
a regiment of soldiers were sent out to strengthen
the embankment of the river. There was no moon,
and they worked away all night by torchlight;
otherwise, as the river roared along with great force
and at a tremendous speed, the Chindawal division of
the town would have been flooded and the houses
washed away.</p>

<p>Îd being a festival everyone was dressed in his
smartest, and the servants all had clean white turbans
and white clothes. According to the custom of the
country I gave presents and a feast to my servants
and guard, and went to the Durbar to salute the Amîr.
I told His Highness that when I was in England I
would take pains to perfect myself in the Persian
language: that I found difficulty in doing so in
Kabul, as I had neither dictionary nor grammar.
His Highness laughed: he said&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Comment.</div>

<p>“I think not. You will take unto yourself a wife,
you will visit your friends, but you will not learn
Persian.”</p>

<p>He was quite right.</p>

<p>Two days after this Prince Habibullah gave me
the first sitting for his portrait. He sat in the
Salaam Khana, and when I arrived I found him in
the upstairs room, the Guest-house, which has large
windows all round. As the light came in every
direction, painting there was an impossibility.</p>

<p>I could not get any shadow under the brow or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
chin to give an effect of relief, and I asked His Highness
if he would sit in another room. As the Prince
had studied the art of photography he understood
the difficulty, and we moved at once to one of the
lower rooms. Here, by shutting the shutters of
one window, and hanging a curtain over the lower
part of another, we managed to get a very fair
light.</p>

<p>There were several of the Prince’s suite in the
room, and when I put in the preliminary charcoal
sketch the Prince’s Shaghassi said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Al-láh! What a colour he is making the Prince.
The Sirdar Sahib is not black!!”</p>

<p>If I had known that I should find photographs of
these portraits of the Princes in possession of the
<cite>Graphic</cite> when I arrived in London, and that woodcuts
of them would be in many of the illustrated London
papers, I should probably have postponed my holiday
for a time and put more work into the paintings. As
it was, Prince Habibullah’s was painted from four
sittings and Prince Nasrullah’s from three. That of
the elder Prince was the better likeness. Prince
Nasrullah’s portrait, on being carried from my house
to the Palace after I had painted His Highness’s name
on it, met with an accident and was badly scratched.
It was sent back to me, therefore, to repair. When
I had it again, it struck me that one part was not
quite correct in drawing, and I worked at it somewhat
without the sitter. When it was dry I sent
it in again. The Prince approved of the alteration,
and he desired to send it back to me yet again,
for he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nasrullah’s Comment.</div>

<p>“Behold! it is handsomer than it was; and if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
send it a third time may be it will become still more
beautiful.”</p>

<p>By the time the pictures were finished Mr. Pyne
had returned to Kabul from India, bringing with
him an English tailor. The day Mr. Pyne arrived
I joined the English party at the Workshops, and we
had dinner together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<span class="smaller smcap">On Leave.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The last Durbar: the Amîr’s remark: a wedding present. Adieux. The journey
down. An awful day: “difficult hot:” the walk. Played out. The stream
and the wall. Triumph: exhaustion. The work of the locusts. Unwelcome
guests: a rejected plan. The breeding establishment: a study in colour. A
want of tact. An illegal march. Simla. The despatch. Dinners and dances.
The study of character: an education. The Armenian in London. The “hub”
of the universe: return to India.</p></div>


<p>On the last day in May I went to the Durbar, for I
thought that surely now I had finished all there was
to do before I started. His Highness received me
most kindly.</p>

<p>I said that in my life I had filled other appointments,
but that His Highness’s kindness to me had
exceeded all that I had met with before. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why should I not treat you kindly? You are a
‘Friend of my Heart.’ I say this not to give you
pleasure, but because I mean it.”</p>

<p>I replied that I felt the honour he did me deeply,
for I was his servant and he a King. He said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have seen many men: high and low; rich and
poor; men of noble descent, and men of obscure birth;
but I call no man a friend of my heart till I have
watched his deeds. I judge a man by his deeds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
not by his words, and again I address you as a Friend
of my Heart.”</p>

<p>His Highness desired me to take eight months’
leave; my pay was to continue during my absence,
and, in addition, he gave me as a wedding present an
order upon his Agent with the Government in India
for a considerable sum of money.</p>

<p>The Armenian, who was to accompany me, received
written instructions relating to the commissions
the Amîr wished executed in London. During
his absence his salary would be paid to his wife in
Kabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adieux.</div>

<p>The next day my packing was done. Firmans for
pack-horses, tents, and guard procured, and I took a
formal leave of His Highness the Amîr.</p>

<p>I visited Prince Habibullah, who received me most
kindly, and after he had conversed with me for about
an hour I took leave of him. I then rode out to
Aliabad, a few miles out of Kabul, where Her Highness
the Sultana was staying, and sent in my salaams
to her and the little Prince Mahomed Omer. Her
Highness sent a large tray of sweetmeats, and
presented me with some very beautiful embroidered
cashmere.</p>

<p>On June 4th, after a good-bye to Mr. Pyne and
the other Englishmen, I started on my journey home.
I will not trace the journey in detail: it was excessively
hot, and I will merely mention one or two
incidents that occurred.</p>

<p>One day the march was particularly trying. We
were at Borikâb. I had breakfast at dawn&mdash;three
small poached-eggs and some tea. The baggage and
tents were sent off, and when the sun rose we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
started gaily. Gaily&mdash;<em>I</em>&mdash;poor fool! little did I
know&mdash;but you shall hear. We trotted and trotted,
and shuffled and climbed by mountain and gorge, over
pebble and rock, until at midday we reached Jigdilik.
We descended, and sat in the valley in the cool shade
of the big trees and had lunch. Mine was a hard-boiled
egg from my holster, a piece of native bread,
and some tea. I thought the march was over, and
lay basking in the shade. Was ever mortal so
deluded!</p>

<p>“Sir, please you get up and start; a long way
we go to-day,”&mdash;thus the Armenian after an
hour.</p>

<p>“Start!! man alive, we started hours ago: you
are not going any further to-day, surely.”</p>

<p>“Sir, we must make haste. Between Dacca and
Lalpur, this month is very difficult hot: and slowly
by slowly it makes hotter. Better this, we get
through it soon: you European.”</p>

<p>Immortal Pluto! not the Turkestan plains over
again!</p>

<p>“Come along, then,” said I, jumping up, “let
us start at once,” and we started.</p>

<p>Along the narrow rocky ravine we rode&mdash;just
after midday in June&mdash;and the sun shot down at
us. It dried our blood, and the glare burnt into
our brain, at any rate, into mine; I don’t know
about the cast-iron Afghans.</p>

<p>Up the long winding gorge we climbed, and at
the summit the breeze struck us. We caught a few
long breaths of coolness, then plunged into another
long winding descent with precipitous rocks on either
side. On and on we trudged, hour after hour, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
at last my bodily powers gave out. This, by the
way, was the road that Brydon went over.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Played Out.</div>

<p>Ride further I could not, for I had not recovered
my strength since last year’s illness. Nine stone
five pounds is not adequate for a man of my height:
it does not leave enough available muscle. Nevertheless,
no one, who is not a Salamander&mdash;an amphibious
animal, allied to the newts, and capable of
living in fire&mdash;can comfortably rest on burning rocks.
There was no shade of any sort, not a tree, nothing,
but glaring rocks and stones. I got off my horse
therefore, and walked. I was conscious at the time
that the Afghan guard thought the sun had made
me mad, and as they eyed me suspiciously, I tried
to assume a fierce aspect, and stalked along down
hill at the rate of five miles an hour. The change
of motion rested the muscles, and the guard on horseback
came shuffling along hastily behind me. Then
came a climb, and I got on again refreshed and
perspiring, but more internally weary, as I found
after riding twenty minutes. Over the rest of the
march I will draw the veil of forgetfulness. It was
too terrible for words.</p>

<p>In the evening, we reached Gundamuk. I perceived
that my tent was being put up in a garden,
and between me and that garden were a stream and
a wall. I had dismounted, my horse had been led
away, and I was standing on my own legs. I had
but little faith in them, for they seemed inclined to
fail me in my hour of need. There was the wall,
staring me in the face, to say nothing of the stream.
True, the stream was but a foot wide, and the wall
had a gap in it, nevertheless, they were difficulties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
to be overcome. There were two courses open to
me: one was to sit on the ground where I was, and
wait until someone could come and help me across:
another was to take time by the forelock and
get across myself somehow or other. Everyone was
busy with the baggage and tents, and no one seemed
to perceive my dilemma: therefore, being resolute by
nature, I determined upon the latter course, and
stood for a time considering how I would accomplish
it.</p>

<p>Staggering boldly to the stream, I allowed myself
to fall forwards till I caught the wall with both
hands; clinging on and clenching my teeth I gave a
vigorous heave to one leg, and in a moment was
astride the gap: nerving myself for another violent
effort I swung the other leg over.</p>

<p>I had conquered, and, moreover, without experiencing
the loss of dignity that a fall in the
stream would have occasioned. Exhilarated by my
success, I reeled into the tent and sank on the carpet.
“Sank,” perhaps, hardly gives the correct impression,
for as soon as the legs were bent at the knee I sat
down with disagreeable suddenness. I then proceeded
to drink large quantities of liquid&mdash;tea, water, and
sherbet&mdash;and when my charpoy was brought into
the tent I climbed on to it and lay down, hoping
to lose my senses in forgetfulness. It was without
avail, and I rolled from side to side seeking rest
and finding none.</p>

<p>In the course of three hours the unwilling fowl
was caught, killed, and cooked, and I made a tough,
moist meal. But now I could rest, and no longer
in vain did I court the Goddess of sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Unwelcome Guests.</div>

<p>Further on in our march we found the locusts had
been at work. Around Jelalabad the country in spite
of the heat had the appearance of winter: the trees
were bare. In the Palace gardens the oranges hung
nearly ripe, but every leaf had gone. When we
arrived there we had afternoon tea in the Guest-house
at the Palace, and afterwards rode on
some few miles beyond Jelalabad, where we
camped.</p>

<p>I had dinner in the open and then went into my
tent to lie down: but I came out again&mdash;quickly.
The locusts had invaded it and had crawled up inside
the tent and over the charpoy, so that all was green&mdash;a
beautiful green shot with pink: but it gave me no
pleasure, the colour seemed out of place. Moreover,
I could not lie down without crunching my unwelcome
guests; and no host, I take it, cares to lie
upon the mangled remains of guests, be they never
so unwelcome.</p>

<p>We had noticed that day as we travelled along
that a careful peasant had dug a shallow pond at
the foot of a beautiful mulberry tree. The locusts
had perforce spared that tree: they might have
tumbled off and they cannot swim; but they had
spitefully nipped off every leaf that spread beyond
the water. A shallow pond, therefore, was dug
some little distance away in the hard-baked earth
for my charpoy to stand in, and since we could not
get the locusts out of the tent, we determined to
take the tent away from the locusts. On further
consideration, however, it seemed likely, and indeed
the Armenian insisted very strongly on the point,
that if I lay all night with my bed in a pond I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
should wake up in the morning with fever or
rheumatism, or something disagreeable which would
be likely to hinder our journey.</p>

<p>We left the pond, therefore, and moved away to
a bare open space with never a blade of grass nor
a leaf anywhere near. Here my tent was pitched,
and with a feeling of restful security I sat upon
my charpoy and enjoyed the cool of the evening.
A tickling sensation at the back of the neck caused
me to raise my hand, and I brushed away a great
locust. Ach! the beasts were all over me: they
seemed to be evolved spontaneously out of nothing.
They were not so, however, for on the mountains
outside Kabul we saw myriads of the young locusts
about the size of black ants hopping about in the
warm sand. This was one of their breeding establishments
where the eggs are hatched. The life-history
of the locust may be looked upon as an
interesting study in colour, for when he is a babe
he is black, as a youth he is pink, and in adult age
green. Two and a-half inches is his length, but he
looks longer: he is all legs and wings. As a creature
that crawls I object to him.</p>

<p>I called for assistance, and the tent was cleared:
but they have no tact, these Locusts, and they came
in again and again like so many Afghan Page boys,
welcome or not. I spent an active and shuddering
evening brushing them off my neck, shoulders, and
wrists. At last in despair I covered my head over
with a sheet and went to sleep, dreaming I was being
crawled over by scorpions and centipedes.</p>

<p>When we got to the “difficult hot” place (<i>sakht</i>,
hard, difficult, severe) between Lalpur and Dacca, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
sky was cloudy, and a strong wind blew. The dust
was awful, but safer than the sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Despatch.</div>

<p>We went through the Khyber on a closed day,
which, I found afterwards, is illegal. The chief of the
Khyber Pathans had been a friend of the Armenian’s
father, and he ordered out the guard of the Pass for
us, so that we could travel on instead of waiting two
or three days. At Jumrood, the end of the Pass,
we were stopped by the order of the British Frontier
Officer, and I heard that, if I had been in the service
of the Government, I should have been liable to imprisonment
in the fort for travelling on the wrong
day. However, we were allowed to proceed.</p>

<p>In Peshawur I got rid of my horses: tipped my
Afghan guard, and took the train to Simla to deliver
a Despatch to His Excellency the Viceroy that His
Highness the Amîr had entrusted me with.</p>

<p>The despatch contained nothing political, but
simply concerned me personally. The Foreign Secretary
kindly gave me a translation of it. This is how it
runs:&mdash;</p>

<p>
(Copy.) “<span class="smcap">Foreign Office, India.</span><br />
</p>

<p>“Translation of a letter from His Highness the
Amîr of Afghanistan and its Dependencies to the
address of His Excellency the Viceroy, dated the 24th
of Showal, 1308 H., corresponding to the 2nd of
June, 1891.</p>

<p>“After compliments.</p>

<p>“I have the honour to inform your Excellency
that Dr. John Gray has asked me for some months’
leave in view to proceed to England and celebrate his
marriage, and, after settling his own domestic affairs,
to return to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have, therefore, given him eight months’ leave,
and it has been settled with him that he should come
back to Kabul at the appointed time.</p>

<p>“This has been written only for your Excellency’s
information, so that your Excellency may be aware of
the circumstance and the manner of leave of Dr.
Gray. Of course, he will do everything which he
thinks necessary for his domestic affairs during the
period of his leave, and, having satisfied himself, he
will, at the approach of the appointed period, start
to come to Kabul in a happy and hopeful state of mind.”</p>

<p>It will be unnecessary to give details of the gay
time we had in Simla. Colonel Wali Ahmad Khan,
the Amîr’s Agent with the Government of India, had
received orders from the Amîr to invite me to the
bungalow that the Government had placed at his disposal.
I stayed with him, therefore, taking the
Armenian and my Indian cook. I had my formal
interview with the Viceroy, dined with His Excellency:
went to several dances at the Viceregal Lodge: was
introduced to Lord Roberts, Lord William Beresford,
the Quartermaster-General, and other gentlemen:
went to numerous dinners, and, after a fortnight’s
gaiety, departed for Bombay, where, accompanied
by the Armenian, I took ship for London.</p>

<p>In India I had been struck by the remarkable
whiteness of an Englishman’s skin: in London I
thought I knew every second man I met. However,
I soon came to the conclusion that it must be the
type I was familiar with, not the individual.</p>

<p>The next thing that appealed to me, after I had
got over the strangeness of seeing “Sahibs” drive
cabs, heave baggage about, and take “tips,” was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
quaint irregularity of an Englishman’s features:
I do not remember noticing that English ladies
appeared in the same light: on the contrary,&mdash;and
the Armenian agreed with me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Armenian in London.</div>

<p>I think the study of character and the endeavouring
to form conclusions as to the course of action that
will probably be taken up by any given individual
under different circumstances, is one of the most
fascinating of studies. Here was a case at hand,
under my own eye, as it were.</p>

<p>I had studied the Armenian for a couple of years
or so and had come to conclusions. I knew what
he would do, and I would watch the development of
his character under the altered circumstances of
life in England. I would observe the enlargement
of his mind as I gradually fed it with greater and
greater wonders.</p>

<p>In India I had thought I would spare him as
much as possible on the journey, lest he became
bewildered by the traffic and the bustle of the railway,
but, somehow, it did not seem to be necessary.</p>

<p>He bought a satchel, slung it over his shoulder,
asked for the money&mdash;which he kept&mdash;took my ticket;
paid the hotel bills; looked after my baggage;
chose the best seat in the railway carriage for me;
bullied other people’s servants if they tried to take
the seat for their masters,&mdash;I heard one man, a
Civil Service official, say, “I fancy the Amîr in all his
glory must be coming down in this train”&mdash;and
altogether he behaved as if he knew all about it.
However, I thought, when we get to the sea and
the great floating Hotel, the P. &amp; O. boat, the
education will begin. He will be astonished. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
he was, but I did not see it. He took everything as
a matter of course; apparently he knew it all before;
doubtless in some other cycle of existence. He
wasn’t even sea-sick.</p>

<p>London, with its thousands, its grandeur, its
turmoil of business, this will take him aback: the
wonder of it must needs appal him.</p>

<p>Appal! He hadn’t been in London a fortnight
before he could tell me what ’bus to take and what
the fare was. He knew all about the “Inner and
Outer Circles,” which is more than I do; and before
long could give an opinion on the relative merits
of a considerable number of the music halls and
theatres in the Metropolis.</p>

<p>It was I who was bewildered, not he. What
manner of man is this, I thought, will nothing
astonish him?</p>

<p>I got orders from the Government for him
to visit the Mint, Woolwich Arsenal, and other
places, and he compared them to similar establishments
in Afghanistan, to the disparagement of the
English ones! I took him to Whiteley’s, saying,
in a casual way, “This is an English shop.” He
took it quietly, but before he left he had accepted
an invitation to a banquet at the Metropôle that
the employées at that establishment were giving.
Moreover, at the dinner he got up and made a
fluent speech!</p>

<p>At my wedding he created a great sensation.
He appeared before us on that occasion in Afghan
costume, and attracted, next to the bride, by far
the greatest amount of attention: <em>I</em> was a necessary,
but unnoticeable appendage: a sort of after thought;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
and all the little girls fell in love with him. After
the ceremony he came into the Vestry and signed
his name, in Persian, in the Register as witness.
He said it was Persian, but it was hard to tell. He
explained the peculiarity of his writing by stating
that a warrior is not a clerk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Return to India.</div>

<p>It came though&mdash;the wonder and the awe: and
I look back with pride upon that day.</p>

<p>I took him to the Crystal Palace and showed him
the display of fireworks at Brock’s benefit.</p>

<p>“Is this anything?” I asked, feebly and almost
in despair. He admitted it: “Yes!” he said,&mdash;this
was really fine: even his father had never seen
anything like it.</p>

<p>It was <em>my</em> education that was being completed,
my mind that was developing, and as I sat and
looked at the Oriental, I felt that perhaps this great
London was, after all, <em>not</em> the “hub of the Universe.”
I was bewildered. What was the “hub!” Was
it Kabul?</p>

<p>When my leave drew to a close, I bade adieu to
my little wife, and sailed for Bombay. It was as
well for the Armenian that we went, for, somehow,
he seemed almost a wreck when we got on board.
I said as much to him, and he accounted for his
condition by saying that the climate of England was
too strong for him.</p>

<p>At Peshawur I found a very kind letter from His
Highness waiting for me, with an order for as many
horses as I needed. The guard were to meet me at
Lundi Kotal Serai.</p>

<p>I will not trace the journey in detail, though one
incident that occurred may be worth relating, showing
as it does what miracles may be worked by the magic
of the Amîr’s name. I had some English firearms
with me&mdash;a couple of rifles and a shot gun&mdash;packed in
cases, which I wished to present to the Amîr, and
when we reached Dacca the Armenian was considerably
disturbed in his mind concerning the safety of these
weapons. The neighbouring Pathans, he said, were
exceedingly clever thieves, and they had a curious
passion for English rifles.</p>

<p>In the evening he told me several interesting
stories, laughable in their cleverness, of the way in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
which these Pathans managed to obtain from Peshawur
weapons of English manufacture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Midnight Alarm.</div>

<p>The tents had been put up facing the river on the
edge of the high bank, in order to catch as much
breeze as possible. The Armenian’s tent was just at
a corner where a nullah or dry water-course cut the
bank; mine was next. The nullah was perhaps twelve
feet deep, and the bank of the river some twenty feet
above the surface of the water.</p>

<p>I turned in about ten o’clock and slept soundly till
about midnight, when I was awakened suddenly by
the sound of a scuffle. Instantly it occurred to me,
“the Shenwarris are after my guns.”</p>

<p>I threw a cloak round me and stepped out of the
tent. It was very dark, but there appeared to be a
free fight going on. I could dimly make out a body
of men struggling, could hear the thuds of blows
and the Armenian’s voluminous voice roaring in manifest
rage. There were no reports of firearms, but
it occurred to me as an advisable precaution to be
possessed of a revolver before entering the <i>mêlée</i>.
Mine, a heavy one, had been carried by the Armenian
the day before, and since he was not using it I concluded
it must be in his tent. Hastily, therefore, so
as not to be out of the fun, I made for his tent.
Remembering the high bank and the rapid river
below, I groped round the back of the tent, stumbling
over the ropes, until&mdash;down I went. I had forgotten
all about the nullah. Instinctively throwing out a
hand, I caught a tent-peg. It cracked dangerously at
the sudden jerk, and for a moment I was hanging over
the edge at arm’s length on this rickety concern; then
I found my feet resting on a ledge. I was very annoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
at being so entirely shelved, and was considering how
I could get out of the position with dignity and
honour, when I heard the sound of some one running
and the Armenian’s voice calling,</p>

<p>“Sir! Sir! Where are you?”</p>

<p>I answered, as it were, from the bowels of the
earth, and when he had localized my whereabouts
he hauled me up. I had to leave my dignity behind.
He said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Sir, please, you go back, you not trouble; <em>I</em>
manage these bally rascal: these dogs’ sons. A
little I afraid you get hurt.”</p>

<p>Of course, I was not going back to my tent until
I knew what the row was all about.</p>

<p>A light was brought. The Colonel commanding
the station, and a crowd of people, all more or less
excited, were to be seen. They pulled out a charpoy
from one of the tents for me to sit on, and tea was
brought&mdash;why, I don’t know. When we had drank
tea everyone began to explain at once. The Colonel
in Persian; the soldiers in Pushtu; and the Armenian
in involved English. The Colonel and the soldiers
spoke very fast and loudly, constantly interrupting
one another, and I caught only a word here and
there. What the Armenian wished to express I
could not imagine. A man was then brought forward
with his arms bound behind his back.</p>

<p>The Colonel and the Armenian seemed much disturbed
that I had fallen down the nullah, but what
the explanation of the bound man was I could not
make out: only this, that he was <em>not</em> a thief after my
rifles. I went to bed again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Next Morning.</div>

<p>In the morning, after breakfast, when every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
had cooled down, I heard the explanation. The
Colonel, it seems, had stationed the guard. All went
quietly for a time until the Armenian, before he
turned in, made a round of the sentries. He found
one point improperly guarded, and ordered one of
the soldiers to move his position. The man refused
with a Pushtu oath: and high words followed. In
this the soldier was no match for the Armenian, and
being exasperated at receiving harder words than
he could return, he endeavoured to stab his bayonet
into the latter.</p>

<p>Such a line of action not meeting the Armenian’s
views as to the eternal fitness of things, he closed
with the soldier. His “education” in England had
not been without effect, and scorning to use a knife,
like a native, he proceeded to punch the soldier’s
head. The magnetic effect of a “fight” caused
other people to run up, and the thuds and scuffle of
the <i>mêlée</i> aroused me.</p>

<p>After the explanation, the unfortunate man, with
his hands bound, was brought forward, and the
Colonel begged me to pronounce sentence upon him.
He said he would carry out any punishment I chose
to impose; whether of fine, imprisonment, or death.
He offered me his revolver, that I might have the
supreme delight of killing the man myself; or, if
that did not meet my views, he would himself shoot
him at once. All this excessive politeness arose
from the fact that I expressed to the Colonel my
sense of dissatisfaction that a distinguished foreigner
could not travel through his district without being
exposed to annoyances of this kind. I asked
whether he thought Amîr Sahib would be satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
with his administrative power. At the mention of
His Highness’s name, the Colonel became greatly
disturbed in his mind, and desired me to look upon
himself as my dog. I said that I was not in need of
a dog just then, and that these words did not please
me. As for judging the man, I was not a magistrate
in the country, how could I take upon myself to
judge him. With a damp forehead and a dry tongue
he begged me, as a friend to the poor, not to report
the matter.</p>

<p>I began gradually to be appeased, to soften the
severe aspect of the countenance, and unbend the
knitted brow, for, as I have frequently remarked, I
am a mild man. The Colonel perceiving his advantage
ordered tea to be brought instantly, and waited
upon me with both hands. “Slowly by slowly” the
threatened storm blew off, and the Colonel, with joy
in his heart, accompanied us miles on the journey,
telling many yarns and amusing stories, whereat we
laughed. We are now great friends&mdash;he and I: for had
I not stood by him in an hour of trouble, when his heart
melted within him, and his interiors were as water!</p>

<p>Riding along we met one of the “running
postmen”: a tall, gaunt hillman without an ounce
of superfluous fat on him. These men run for a
certain number of miles with the sealed leather
post satchel, and then pass it on to the next. There
are rough sheds by the wayside where each remains
till his turn comes. They carry a long bamboo lance
tipped and shod with steel, and with a small bell
fixed just below the blade. The post for India
leaves Kabul on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and
that from India arrives on Sundays and Thursdays.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>At the stage before Kabul I had received a letter
from His Highness directing me to take possession
of the house I formerly occupied in the town: to rest
for a day; and on the following day to come on to
Endekki, when he would receive me.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Arrival.</div>

<p>We arrived at Kabul on a Sunday morning, in
March, 1892. It was a proud day for the Armenian
as he rode through the bazaar with his solar helmet
on one side&mdash;no miserable native turban for him now.
His hand was on his hip and his elbow pointed outwards:
his uplifted head desired to strike the stars.
With a lofty pity, not unmingled with contempt, he
gazed around at the admiring faces of the salaaming
Kabulis. Was he not a traveller of renown: one
who had crossed the great river and penetrated to
the very heart of the Feringhi country!</p>

<p>Mr. Walter, the tailor, rode out to meet us; he
said to the Armenian:</p>

<p>“Well, did you like London?”</p>

<p>“Sir, what <em>d’you</em> think! But London is very
good place for rich man, very bad place for poor
man. Kabul is good for poor man.”</p>

<p>“What did you do in London?” asked Mr.
Walter.</p>

<p>“O, Sir! A little I walk this way and that, and
upon ladies I pinch eyes.”</p>

<p>By this I fancy he must have meant he winked.
It was a revelation to me, and I looked at him
severely. What other remarkable development
might I not detect!</p>

<p>I heard from Mr. Walter that the two engineers,
Messrs. Stewart and Myddleton, had departed, and
their places were taken by two Scotchmen. Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
Pyne had gone to England on leave and had not
yet returned. He was to bring out several other
Englishmen.</p>

<p>The Armenian had the house swept out, the
carpets down, and everything straight in a very
short time. Several people called in the afternoon.
Some of the Armenian’s relatives: the Compounder;
and some Afghans whom I knew. I found half-a-dozen
letters waiting for me, one from my wife,
whereat I rejoiced, and one from a lady missionary
in India who wished to enter the Amîr’s service as
medical attendant upon the Harem.</p>

<p>I had met another lady in Peshawur who also
wished to enter the Amîr’s service. She was attached
to the Afghan Mission in that town, and spoke Persian,
Pushtu, and Hindustani, and had had some medical
training. She told me she was intending to travel
to Kabul, in disguise, with the Koffla, the travelling
merchants. She was young, and I endeavoured to
point out some of the dangers she would be exposed
to from Afghan ruffians, and did my best to dissuade
her from such a rash undertaking. It seemed to me
the conception was an utterly mad one, but that if
she desired greatly to enter the service the best thing
would be to write and apply to His Highness. However,
she did not write that I know of.</p>

<p>The other lady missionary who wrote was much
older, and in due time I had her letter translated and
laid before His Highness. How the Amîr received
the application I will relate presently.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival I rode to the Endekki
Palace to salaam the Amîr. In the great hall I met
many of the Court whom I knew, and chatted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
them. As soon as His Highness rose I was called to
the inner room.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Welcome.</div>

<p>I found His Highness seated on a couch of crimson
and gold. He was dressed in a black morning suit,
with an ordinary English shirt and collar: he looked
very European, and his hands, on which were some
beautiful rings, struck me as being singularly white.
He had picked up wonderfully since June, when I
saw him last, was nothing like so thin, and looked
exceedingly well. The room had the appearance of a
lady’s boudoir, with flowers, vases, embroideries, piano,
and so on.</p>

<p>I bowed as I entered the room, and His Highness
smiled and beckoned me forwards. He held my hand
some minutes while he made kindly enquiries as to
my health; and he asked was my wife well and the
other members of my family.</p>

<p>He said he was exceedingly pleased to see me
again, and he thanked God that I had returned safely.
He then allowed me to be seated.</p>

<p>He enquired the date of my wedding, and on
hearing that my married life had lasted only for three
months and a-half, he said: “How sorrowful your
wife must be, how sorrowful she must be.” Presently
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will grant you leave of absence again soon;
you shall go to your home when the winter comes.”</p>

<p>He promised, with great kindness, that every
preparation should be made for the reception of Mrs.
Gray in Kabul, and desired her to be accompanied by
two English maidservants, whose salaries he would
charge himself with. When she felt a longing to
return to England she should go: if, however, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
did not care to accompany me back to Kabul, he would
from time to time give me leave of absence at short
intervals. As regards transmitting pay, he said he
would order any proportion of my salary that I wished,
to be paid either in London or to my bankers in
Bombay.</p>

<p>He told me that both coal and iron had been found
in the country, and he said that it was his intention
soon to visit England himself. He referred to the
death of Prince Albert Victor, and spoke highly of
him, and I remember he told me an anecdote in the
life of the Prince. He spoke some little time on
other matters, and then tea and cigarettes were
brought. There had been no one in the room with His
Highness during the interview, except myself, the
Armenian, and one of the Page boys. After being
with His Highness four or five hours, I asked permission
to withdraw, and then visited Malek, the
Page, who was ill. He seemed very pleased to see me.</p>

<p>The next day, Tuesday, was a military Durbar,
and I visited His Highness again, taking with me
the rifles I had brought, as I wished to present them
to him. His Highness received me kindly, and
accepted the present I laid before him. I had also
brought for Prince Habibullah a plumed helmet,
such as an officer in India would wear. The Prince
was at the Durbar, and His Highness, after examining
the helmet, kindly allowed me to present it to
the Prince.</p>

<p>There were a great many of the Afghan military
officers present: they were seated along the side
of the room, and among them was the new British
Agent, the Sirdar Mahomed Afzal Khan. The former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
agent, Colonel Attaullah Khan, having been long a
resident at the Amîr’s Court, had withdrawn.
Lunch was served, and at five o’clock I came
away.</p>

<p>The next day the fast of Ramazàn commenced,
and I got to work at the Hospital.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards I rode out to the country
house where Her Highness, the Sultana, was living,
and sent in my salaams with a present of silks and
so on that I had brought for her and the little
Prince Mahomed Omer. A kind message was received
in reply, and after the usual tea, cigarettes,
and sweets, I rode back to Kabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Salaam to the Prince.</div>

<p>A day or two afterwards, I paid a formal visit
to Prince Habibullah. He was living in the bungalow
of the Bâbur Gardens.</p>

<p>It was a pretty garden with fountains, flowers
and trees, situated on the slope of the mountains
outside Kabul, in a sort of natural concavity in
the hills.</p>

<p>The Prince received me most kindly, and talked
for some time, asking me many questions about
London. He desired me also to paint another
portrait of himself; which, by the way, I never had
the opportunity of doing.</p>

<p>One afternoon in the next week I again visited
His Highness, the Amîr, taking with me the letter
of the lady missionary who desired to enter the
Amîr’s service.</p>

<p>While I was waiting in the great hall, smoking
cigarettes, my old friend, General Nassir Khan, came
and chatted with me, saying how pleased he was to see
me back again. Another friend also came and spoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
to me, the Brigadier Hadji Gul Khan. I do not
know if he was as pleased to see me as the General,
for he had been living in my house while I was in
London, and had to turn out when I came back;
however, he expressed himself as delighted.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when I arrived at
the Palace, and when I was called in to the Amîr
the dusk of the evening had fallen. As soon as I
entered the room, His Highness called my attention
to a most picturesque evening effect that could
be seen from his window. A brilliant gleam of light
appeared between the clouds in the sky, the mountains
could be seen shadowy but distinct; the middle
ground was in deep shadow, and in the foreground
were the Palace gardens and fountains lit by the
light from the Palace.</p>

<p>His Highness read the translation of the lady
missionary’s letter, and said, that at present the
country was too unsettled in condition for it to be
a suitable field for the efforts of an English lady
doctor. When, however, Mrs. Gray accompanied
me to Kabul, the lady might travel with her. His
Highness spoke some time, and told me that in future,
when I wished to see him, there was no need for me
to write and make an appointment: he would receive
me at any time, day or night. I got home at nine
o’clock in the evening and wrote to the lady missionary,
telling her as nearly as I could His Highness’s
words. Mrs. Gray never went to Kabul,
nor I believe did the lady missionary.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fatal Ramazàn.</div>

<p>Four days after this was Good Friday, April 15th,
and three cases of cholera occurred in the town. It
was “Ramazàn,” when good Mahomedans fast all
day and eat enormously at night. Knowing as I did
something of the careless nature of Asiatics: of the
awful condition, sanitarily speaking, of the town of
Kabul: of the insufficiency and impurity of the water
supply: it seemed to me that the disease <em>must</em> spread
with deadly rapidity.</p>

<p>The conjecture was only too correct.</p>

<p>The Europeans in Kabul readily understanding the
serious condition of affairs, were easily induced to
take suitable precautions, such as the avoidance of
fruit and uncooked vegetables; the drinking of water
only after it had been boiled and filtered; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
careful abstention from any kind of excess in either
eating or drinking.</p>

<p>For the natives, I ordered to be posted about in
the bazaars, notices in Persian advising similar precautions;
and described a simple filter in which after
water had been boiled it could be run through sand
and charcoal; for sand and charcoal were both of them
to be easily obtained in the town. I sent an inspector&mdash;my
Burma policeman&mdash;with a band of soldiers to
examine if the city scavengers did their duty, and
to order the removal from the town of all filth that
they could get access to. I brought forth all the
barrels of disinfectant powder that the Hospital contained,
but which was of necessity pitiably insufficient,
and ordered its free use in all suspicious places.</p>

<p>At first, cases among the soldiers were reported
to me, and I attempted isolation: but soon this was
utterly impossible, for the men fell in numbers that
increased alarmingly day by day. In the town the
disease, as is usual with cholera, was most erratic
in its onslaughts. I endeavoured to institute the
reporting of cases to me as soon as they arose,
but it was a useless attempt, and scores died before
I even heard of them. Two days after the commencement,
namely, on April 17th, it was reported,
that between six a.m. and six p.m. there were a
hundred and eighty-five corpses carried out of
Kabul for burial. The number of deaths was, I
heard, reported daily to His Highness, though to me
this was of less importance than the daily number
of fresh cases. The sick soon ceased calling for
Hakims, and their friends came in increasing crowds
to my house for European medicines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>I gave them pills containing opium and acetate of
lead, to be taken at certain intervals, to the number
of three. No food nor drink was to be taken; but to
allay the intense thirst the patient might suck ice.
For the severe abdominal pain mustard poultices, and
for the agonizing cramps in the limbs massage, were
to be employed. This was the general treatment,
varied of course for special cases and complications.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Dread.</div>

<p>Day by day the great shadow deepened over
the city. A sickening dread was in the heart of
each; for who might not be the next victim? Men
gathered together and cheered themselves with
forced gaiety, and bhang, or sat with terror-stricken
faces waiting for death. Wailing was in every house,
and one could not ride ten yards without meeting
parties of mourners carrying out fresh victims to the
graveyard.</p>

<p>“The cholera is in the air,” they said.</p>

<p>The Amîr ordered processions to march to the
Mosques with banners and music and pray for
deliverance. Can one believe it! but such was the
paralysing effect of “Kismet,” or of terror, in the
town, that the men were driven to the Mosques with
sticks by the soldiers ere they would move.</p>

<p>With the fatalism of their nature it was not to
be hoped that they would take the precautions to
avoid infection&mdash;ordinary and simple though they
were&mdash;that I had pointed out.</p>

<p>The bodies of the dead were washed in the Kabul
river, from which most of the drinking water of the
town was obtained! They were carried through
the gorge by the river-side and buried near the
road at the foot of the Asmai Mountain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>If a man were thirsty he drank whatever water
was at hand: out of an irrigation ditch fouled with
wayside filth, from a polluted well, or the Kabul
river. So far from avoiding fruit and vegetables
the townspeople ate of them largely.</p>

<p>When men dropped down in the Durbar, and the
Palace attendants were seized, the Amîr and the Court
moved from Endekki to Rish Khor, in the direction
of the Paghman Hills.</p>

<p>As I was needed among the sick, His Highness
did not withdraw me from the town. I was living
between Chandawal and the gardens around Timur’s
Tomb, and soon the cholera spread its wings over us.
The houses near me were made desolate, and one of
my servants lay dying in the garden.</p>

<p>This man was an Afghan hillman, a good fellow,
cheery, and really, it seemed to me, honest. No one
told me when he was first taken, for he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why should the Doctor Sahib be troubled for
such as I, he has enough work with others.”</p>

<p>The next day when the pains and the cramps came
on, one of the servants reported the matter to me.
I went to the man at once, but it was too late; he
was collapsed, with sunken eyes, his nose was peaky
and blue, the skin of his body cold and his hands
shrivelled. I looked at the other servants and asked
why I was not told of this before.</p>

<p>None of them answered. The man seemed
grateful that I had seen him, but he died in the
night.</p>

<p>I visited a good many at their houses. It would
have been absurd to wait for an order from the
Amîr at a time such as this; sometimes I took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
Armenian to translate, at other times I went alone,
for I knew enough Persian to get along with. My
guard&mdash;often a single or a couple of soldiers&mdash;waited
outside the house while I went in. A guard was
really superfluous, for no one was likely to hurt
me: on the contrary, I was welcomed with every
sign of gratitude.</p>

<p>As regards the form of treatment I had adopted,
I found it successful in a great many cases, though
the proportion of those who recovered, compared with
the number of deaths in the town, was doubtless
excessively small. Hundreds, however, took the
medicine whom I never saw. Some would carry out
the instructions I gave them to the letter, others
would take the medicine but consult their friends as
to the instructions. These cases did not do so well,
and I ceased attending where I was not obeyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exodus of the Court.</div>

<p>On the 21st of April, the cholera spread to Rish
Khor, and there was an exodus of the Court to the
Paghman Mountains. Here the water was good,
tumbling down in many little cascades from the hills.
One day I was seized with vomiting and was ill, and
the Amîr hearing of it sent to enquire how I was.
Happily by the time the messenger arrived I was
better. Soon the road between Paghman and the
infected city was closed, and sentries were posted to
cut off all communication.</p>

<p>In the Arm Foundry the native workmen dropped
down at the benches, and work was stopped for want
of men to do it.</p>

<p>I was called to see one of the storekeepers of
the foundry, Gholam Nuksh Ban, who was seized.
I had hopes for him, and the second day he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
better. After that he ceased following the instructions
I gave, and took the advice of Hakims and
friends. I found him drinking curds and whey, and
large quantities of water: I left him therefore.
Vomiting returned with excessive violence and he
died. Before he died, however, he gave into my
hands a magazine rifle that I had bought for the
Amîr in London, but which had been detained at
the Frontier and afterwards sent on.</p>

<p>The Armenian went the round of the bazaars
to inspect the food sold. He was not a skilled
inspector, but he could at least distinguish rancid
butter, sour milk, putrid meat, or decomposing
vegetables, when he saw them.</p>

<p>At this time the Hazaras broke out in rebellion,
and the locusts invaded Kabul again. The latter, wise
creatures, did not stay; they passed on.</p>

<p>I received an order to attend one of the Chamberlains
of Prince Habibullah, and I went to his house.
To see a stranger in the grip of cholera is bad; but to
see a man you know, is a horror that catches you in
the throat. There were the shrunken features and
ashy-grey face of a dreadful ghost of the man I knew.
I tried hard to save this man’s life. Visiting him time
after time, I made his men do as I said. The look in
the eyes of a man when he greets you, feeling the
dread phantom loosening its hold and his life coming
back to him, is a thing to remember.</p>

<p>The Dabier-ul-Mulk, Chief Secretary to the Amîr,
and the man, I suppose, most trusted by His Highness,
was seized. I was sorry I received no order to attend
him. He died.</p>

<p>Of the four Englishmen who were in Kabul at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
onset of the disease none were ill&mdash;with the exception
of my own slight attack.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks the cholera lessened in
severity in the town and spread more in the surrounding
villages. It returned, however, again and
again, and the mortality was excessive. By the beginning
of June I was informed that eleven thousand
deaths had been reported to His Highness in Kabul
and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Among other stories I heard at the time was one of
a man falling and dying just outside the town, near
the execution ground. The body was not seen till the
following morning, when a man riding by saw the
pariah dogs that prowl in that neighbourhood snarling
and worrying over something.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“British Motives!”</div>

<p>Another story, less hideous and perhaps more
interesting was this: A man coming up to a group
standing in the street said&mdash;</p>

<p>“A relative of mine is ill with this disease.”</p>

<p>Said one of the group&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why go you not at once to the English Doctor,
he is giving medicine.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered the man, “the British Government
sent him here to poison as many as he can.”</p>

<p>“Khair,” said a third, “not so. To my wife, ill with
this disease, he gave a medicine: she is now well.”</p>

<p>“Beshak,” said a fourth. “Undoubtedly; but the
Sirkar-i-Engrez send him that by curing us he may
gain our friendship. Thus they hope to draw away
the people and the country from Amîr Sahib, that they
may come themselves and rule us.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile another Englishman, Mr. Clemence,
had arrived. He brought with him from England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
two or three thoroughbred stallions and some
hackneys, for the improvement of the Amîr’s stud.
He had, however, been directed to make a detour and
avoid Kabul, and had been conducted to Faizabad,
where he took up his quarters. Shortly afterwards
he rode into Kabul to visit the other Englishmen:
a woeful time to arrive in a strange town.</p>

<p>About the middle of June we had violent thunder
storms and heavy rain, a most unusual occurrence at
that time of the year, and the weather became cool,
much cooler than it was in April.</p>

<p>The cholera now appeared to be dying out, and
men began to draw their breath again and to recover
from the oppressive dread. I wrote to His Highness
and enquired his health. He replied that he was well,
and invited me to visit him at Paghman.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful ride of about fifteen miles. First
there is the Chahardeh Valley, with cornfields, hedges,
and gardens; then the incline at the foot of the
mountains; the Paghman Valley, and a last steep
climb to the Royal residence.</p>

<p>It was very cool at Paghman; there were trees,
flowers, and waterfalls, but the corn instead of being
ripe was green. Almost directly we arrived at the
Palace I was shown into the room where His Highness
was sitting, and he greeted me most kindly. He
referred to the cholera, and reminded me that I had
told him at my last interview how very little sickness
there was, so that Doctors and Hakims had very
little to do.</p>

<p>Tea and cigarettes were brought, and His Highness
directed the Pages to offer me the cakes and biscuits
that were brought for his own breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>By-and-bye there were some soldiers brought in,
in chains. His Highness called my attention to them,
and told me the story of their offences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anger of the Amîr.</div>

<p>It was quite a long story. They had formed a
conspiracy against their Captain, whom they had
accused of oppression and other evils. His Highness
dilated at some length upon their iniquities, and finally
said&mdash;</p>

<p>“What can one do with such men?”</p>

<p>They threw themselves on the ground, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Tobah! tobah!”&mdash;“Alas! alas!”</p>

<p>The Amîr said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Nay! the time is past for ‘tobah.’ You have
admitted before the Priest that the accusation you
made against your officer was false.”</p>

<p>One began to say that he was “Amîr Sahib’s
servant.”</p>

<p>“What word is this?” thundered the Amîr, “my
servant!! This General is my servant, this man and
this (the Treasury Officer and the Deputy Commander-in-Chief),
these are my servants. You? You
are the dog of my servants!”</p>

<p>“What shall I do to you?” he said, as they stood
quaking. Then he added,</p>

<p>“You shall be taken from here to a room apart,
there shall you sit and debate among yourselves what
your punishment shall be, and to-morrow you shall
again be brought before me.”</p>

<p>Then they were hurried away.</p>

<p>What the choice of each one was I do not know,
but I had occasion to learn the choice of some of
them. A few days afterwards on visiting the Sherpur
Hospital I saw four or five of the men. They each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
greeted me with a wan smile and held up the left arm&mdash;the
hand had been severed at the wrist joint.</p>

<p>His Highness then continued talking to me concerning
the causes of cholera, and he ordered a
specimen of Paghman drinking water to be brought.
While I was examining it, the windows commenced
rattling, and I thought vaguely that the wind must
have risen very suddenly. Hearing a bustle I looked
up and saw the Pages hurrying together and the Amîr
standing. I jumped up at once. A moment or two
afterwards His Highness sat down again, motioning
me to do the same. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Did you not recognize the cause of that noise?”</p>

<p>“No, Sir,” I answered, “I thought it was the wind.”</p>

<p>He laughed and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“It was an earthquake! Another time you must
be quicker and get out of the house.” He said that
the motion of the earth in an earthquake, at any
given spot, was in a vertical, not a horizontal direction.
Were it in a horizontal direction, he said, the very
mountains would fall. Being in a vertical direction
the pressure on the beams of a house, owing to the
weight of the roof, becomes excessive, and they are
likely to give way. For this reason it is advisable to
get out into the open when an earthquake commences.</p>

<p>Soon after this His Highness wrote a few words
on a slip of paper, and calling the Armenian to him
he handed him the paper. When the Armenian
returned to me he whispered that the Amîr had
increased my pay considerably. I commenced to
thank His Highness, but he smiled, and silenced me
by raising his hand.</p>

<p>About four o’clock, dinner was brought. For me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
a European one was provided, the only peculiarity of
which was that the soup followed the fish.</p>

<p>After dinner, His Highness asked me if I was
returning to Kabul that night, or whether I would
remain at Paghman till the morning. As I had six
horses with me I decided to return. His Highness
asked me before I left to visit the “Ferrash-bashi,” or
“Keeper of the Carpets,” who was ill. This was the
gentleman I met first in Turkestan, who struck me
as being “not such a villain as he looked.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, I called upon him at his house in
Paghman, which was some distance down the hill.</p>

<p>I found he had had a stroke, and was paralyzed
on one side. I gave him advice, and said I would
ride over in a day or two to see him again. Night
came on as we were riding home, and we had to do
the last two or three miles at a walk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arrival of English.</div>

<p>At this time Mr. Pyne was on his way back to
Kabul after the termination of his leave; and two
days after my visit to Paghman he arrived in the
town, bringing with him Mr. Arthur Collins, who
had entered the service as geologist. Being well
mounted they had ridden the last two stages in
a day, arriving in Kabul in the evening. Coming
so quickly they were ahead of their baggage, and had
had nothing to eat since the early morning. A dinner
was soon provided, and I sent them plates, knives,
and forks; and blankets for the night.</p>

<p>Several other Englishmen had entered the
service, who arrived the next day with the baggage.
There were two more assistant engineers;
a mining assistant to Mr. Collins; a gardener, and
a lapidary. The last did not stay long, as it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
found that the native lapidaries could do ordinary
work; and extraordinary work, such as the Amîr
hoped for, was, I understood, only possible with
special machinery. About a month afterwards two
other Englishmen arrived, a tanner and a currier
from Yorkshire: so that at this time there were
no less than fourteen Englishmen in Kabul.</p>

<p>The day after the arrival of the Englishmen I
rode over to Paghman again to see the Ferrash-bashi.
Mr. Walter, the tailor, who wished to try
a coat on the little Prince Mahomed Omer, accompanied
me. I found my patient no worse, and after
lunching off some delicious Paghman cherries I went
on to the Palace to salaam His Highness.</p>

<p>After salutations, tea, and cigarettes, His Highness
told me the story of a severe illness he suffered
from when he was a youth. He was a General in
his father’s army, and was so ill that he had to be
carried to the wars on a charpoy. He was hoisted on
to men’s shoulders, or on to a house top, or hill, to
see the battles. The Hakims told him that the
illness he suffered from was due to the presence of
a large worm or snake in his stomach. Medicine
after medicine was used without avail: and large
quantities of iced water were drunk with the intention
of chilling the creature and driving it out. This being
unsuccessful an idea struck the Amîr: he abstained
from food for many hours, and then ordered to be
prepared a very delicious and savoury dinner, and
he sat with this in front of him hoping to tempt the
worm. It was successful, and feeling the creature
crawling up his throat he waited; then seizing the
head he drew it forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Comment.</div>

<p>“Thus did I succeed in getting rid of the vile
creature,” said the Amîr, and, suiting the action to
the word, he appeared to be drawing a rope from his
mouth, hand over hand.</p>

<p>In a serious and profoundly interesting account
of a Royal illness and cure, it was exceedingly improper
for me to be affected by the humorous side of
the narrative; but, try as I would to prevent it, a
shadow of a smile appeared. His Highness noticing
it looked very straight at me and said&mdash;</p>

<p>“I tell you this for your own guidance. I have
here a man suffering from the same disease. Him
I desire you to examine. Administer such medicines
as you deem suitable, giving also due weight to the
narrative I have related of my own sufferings and
cure, that thus his recovery may be ensured.”</p>

<p>I found that the patient was suffering from a
disease that was, perhaps, less interesting than that
His Highness suffered from: he had cancer of the
stomach. I am sorry to say I was of necessity less
successful in treating him than His Highness had
been in treating himself.</p>

<p>After some further talk with His Highness, I
retired and rode back to the Ferrash-bashi’s. It
seems that the last time I had gone to see His
Highness, he had ordered tents and dinner to be
brought for me to the patient’s house: they arrived
about half-an-hour after we had left. This time,
therefore, we stayed. The tents were put up on
the grass in the cherry orchard: a couch, covered
with yellow and purple silk, was brought from the
Palace and dinner arrived. The dishes had been
taken before His Highness for approval: the tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
was then covered with a white cloth and sealed
before him. I was informed of the arrival of dinner:
the seal was broken in my presence; and the dishes
made hot at a fire on the grass outside my tent. I
dined: then after more cherries and a smoke, I retired
to my gorgeous couch, well-pleased with myself
and everybody else.</p>

<p>The next morning, after breakfast, we rode back
to Kabul. I was going down the long slope from
the Paghman Hills at a smart trot, when I heard
a sudden exclamation, and, looking back, saw the
Armenian and his horse go headlong: he was riding
the brute of mine that stumbled. I shouted to a
soldier to catch my bridle, and sprang off to see
what the damage was, for the horse had rolled over
the Armenian’s leg. He was crushed and bruised a
good deal, and the skin scraped off his leg, but there
were no breakages. He had, however, a bump on his
head big enough for all practical purposes. We sat
for a little by the wayside till he had recovered, then
he got on another horse, and we went the rest of the
way at a walk.</p>

<p>After dinner, I luxuriated in a long chair opposite
the window. The view was the sky and an
apple-tree laden with fruit: beyond were vines,
apricot, and almond trees; in the distance over the
tree-tops was the purple and shadowy summit of a
mountain. The doves were coo-cooing, and the
sparrows chirping. Later, the moon came out and
the hoophoe cried “Hood-hood.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Political Durbar.</div>

<p>A week after this, July 4th, was the Festival of Îd,
and in the morning I rode with the Armenian to
Paghman to salaam His Highness. The other Englishmen
followed later in the day. We arrived about
eleven a.m. The review of troops and prayers
were finished, and His Highness had just taken
his seat in the Durbar Hall. I was admitted at once
into the presence, and bowing said, through the
Armenian, that I wished His Highness all happiness.
A chair was then ordered to be placed for me in
a bay window: it was not so near His Highness as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
usual, and I was wondering why, when the Armenian
whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is a Durbar of Chiefs and Maleks.”</p>

<p>Presently the hall began to fill, but His Highness
allowed no one to be placed between himself and me,
and even ordered a vase of flowers on the table in
front of him to be moved so that he could see me
distinctly.</p>

<p>The visitors were Army Officers and Chiefs from
all parts of the country; Turkomans, Hazaras, and
Afghans. I rather wished myself out of it, fearing
that my visit had been inopportune.</p>

<p>At the end of the room in an arm-chair by an
open window sat His Highness. Outside were the
guard and a crowd of some hundreds of people.
In a chair on the Amîr’s left, and at some little
distance, sat Prince Habibullah: he was attired in a
scarlet uniform with plumed helmet. Everyone else
sat on the ground. On His Highness’s right were
Prince Nasrullah, Sirdar Usuf, the Amîr’s uncle,
and the British Agent: then came the principal
military officers; and all round the room the Chiefs
and Maleks.</p>

<p>Seeing the British Agent I was relieved, feeling
sure that, after all, my visit was not an intrusion.
I could not but admire His Highness’s tact in the
way in which, having allowed me to be present
unofficially in a State Durbar, he considered the
European feeling of dignity in allowing me a chair
with no one between himself and me; and considered
also the jealous pride of the Afghans in placing me
in the window, and, as it were, outside the circle.</p>

<p>His Highness addressed his audience for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
little time, chiefly in Pushtu but partly in Persian.
It did not concern me, and I paid no attention.
Glancing out of the window where I was sitting I saw
one of His Highness’s guard stationed there with
fixed bayonet. As he caught my eye he salaamed and
smiled. I could not think at first who he was: then
I remembered I had attended him in Turkestan for
double pneumonia when he was very dangerously ill.
He had recovered, and I saw no more of him till this
day: he had grown so plump that at first I did
not recognize him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Banquet.</div>

<p>When the talking was over sweetmeats were
brought, and His Highness sent me a plateful from
his table. Outside were bands of music: at one time
a native band with flageolets and drums was playing,
then would follow a brass band, afterwards the bagpipes
playing Scotch tunes. In the Hall at the lower
end were dancing boys, singers, and musicians. These
continued their performances during lunch, which was
brought in at three o’clock. For me there was a
slight innovation. His Highness ordered a dinner-napkin
to be placed on the little table in front of me.
The waiter did not quite understand the management
of it, for he insisted upon one edge of it being put
on the table under the plate and the other on my
knees: finally, however, I was allowed to have it my
own way, chiefly by the Armenian’s instrumentality:
learning all about these things was part of his
education in England.</p>

<p>After dinner came fruit&mdash;cherries and mulberries,
and finally cigarettes and tea. Then I asked permission
to withdraw and came away.</p>

<p>In August the cholera, which had returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
Kabul, began again to attain serious proportions. I
had drawn up with some care a Paper on the precautions
to be adopted to prevent a return of the
disease. I was perforce compelled to allow the
Hindustani Interpreter&mdash;the Gnat&mdash;to take possession
of it for the purpose of translation. I need
scarcely say that I never saw or heard anything
of the paper afterwards. The Armenian at this time
was very busily employed in translating for some
others of the Englishmen, for the supply of Interpreters
was lamentably small. In the Hospitals I, of
course, could manage without one, but for conversations
with His Highness or for the translation of
writings my knowledge of the language was inadequate.</p>

<p>Though none of the English were seized with
cholera, the climate of Kabul affected the health of
most of them deleteriously. Some had fever severely:
others bowel complaints; and the gardener, Mr. Wild,
a Yorkshireman, who had been working very hard in
the sun, laying out gardens and digging, went down
with heat apoplexy. He was dangerously ill, and
I attended him; but some interesting and engaging
scoundrel spread the report that he was shirking
his work and lying intoxicated in his room. As
he received an order to leave the service I wrote
to His Highness detailing the facts of the case. His
Highness at once desired Wild to be brought to
Paghman, as soon as his condition would allow.
When he was taken there His Highness most kindly
kept him in the cool air of the mountains until he
recovered. After this Wild, by my advice, wore
a turban in the sun instead of a solar topee. A pith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
topee would have been a sufficient protection, but
there was none to be got in the bazaars, and
sending money to Peshawur for anything was a
procedure of doubtful success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Illness of Prince Nasrullah.</div>

<p>One day a soldier on horseback arrived at my
house to call me to visit Prince Nasrullah who, he
said, was ill. His Highness at this time was living
in a bungalow set in a beautiful garden on the
slope near the Paghman Mountains. I started off
immediately. After a nine or ten miles’ ride we
reached Prince Nasrullah’s bungalow, and at once I
was shown into the room where the Prince was
sitting. It appeared to be full of people&mdash;Officers,
Hakims, Pages, and Chamberlains.</p>

<p>After the usual salutations a chair was placed
for me, and tea and cigarettes brought. The Prince
held a polite conversation with me for some little
while, and I began to wonder if I had not misunderstood
the messenger, when he said His Highness
was ill. Presently, however, the Prince explained that
he was suffering great pain. I enquired where the
pain seized him. He said that a worm had partly
eaten one of his teeth, and this caused him pain.
I thought it quite likely that this would be painful,
and asked, might I examine the tooth. An arm-chair
was placed in a convenient position facing the
window, and His Highness seated himself, politely
opening his mouth to allow me every facility in
examining the worm-eaten tooth.</p>

<p>After a careful examination I gave my opinion
that the tooth should be removed. The Prince at
once consented to the operation, and a soldier was
sent galloping off to the Kabul Hospital for the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
of tooth instruments. The Prince conversed with me
cheerfully for a time while I smoked. By-and-bye
he seemed to become thoughtful, and presently he
said he was a little doubtful about the advisability
of removing the tooth: perhaps the application of a
suitable medicine might relieve the pain and check the
disease. I explained that the immediate pain might
indeed be removed by a medicine, but that it would
probably return, and that the disease had made such
progress that the tooth would, if left, be a source of
constant annoyance. His Highness was silent for a
time, but presently he expressed his doubts as to the
possibility of extracting the tooth; so far as he could
judge there was nothing but a shell left: was it
not exceedingly likely that the shell would crush up
and leave him in a worse plight than he at present
was? I said that a calamity of that nature was of
course possible, as he, in his wisdom had foreseen, but
that my hopes and prayers were that it might not
occur. By-and-bye the messenger arrived with the
tooth-case. The Prince again weighed the matter
carefully, and he desired the two chief Hakims in
the room to consult and give their opinion. I do
not know what they said but they looked unutterably
wise.</p>

<p>After a considerable amount of discussion, in which
I took no part, the Prince suddenly decided that the
operation should be performed. He seated himself
in the chair: a Page at my request held His Highness’s
astrakhan hat: another held the chillimchi or
spittoon: and a third a silver cup containing water.</p>

<p>I suggested that His Highness should seize the
arms of the chair and hold them tight; then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
opened his mouth. An attendant handed me the
forceps, which had been warmed: I fitted them round
the neck of the offending member and pushed them
well home: a twist of the wrist and the tooth was
out. His Highness made no remark during the
operation, but at the critical moment he patted his
feet on the ground. He was, I believe, exceedingly
gratified that the operation was successful, for not
only did he present me with a suit of clothes,
which unfortunately were much too small for
me, but he politely said that the operation had not
hurt him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effect of Example.</div>

<p>Glancing up as soon as it was over, I saw that
the soldiers of the bodyguard had formed themselves
in double line from the window down the garden,
and were forming an interested row of spectators.
Immediately afterwards several of them begged me
to perform a similar operation upon them. I glanced
at the Prince for permission, which he kindly granted:
then, seating the men on the ground one after
another, I removed such teeth as they desired. One
reservation alone I made: when a tooth had not the
slightest appearance of disease&mdash;not a speck&mdash;I
refused to extract it, at any rate that day. The
unfortunates who could not have their teeth out
seemed quite hurt: why should I draw other men’s
teeth and not theirs? I promised, therefore, to do
them this favour as soon as they could prove to my
satisfaction that their teeth were “worm-eaten.”</p>

<p>One day, a fortnight or so after this, I went with
Mr. Pyne, Mr. Collins, and some others of the
English, to Paghman to hold a discussion before
the Amîr concerning two of the Englishmen who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
had allowed their disgust of Oriental life to influence
their conduct, and being <i>ennuié</i>, had for some time
indulged unduly in alcoholic stimulant. His Highness
treated the whole matter as a joke. One of the
workmen being unnecessary was allowed to resign.
The other was to stay. As the latter was exceedingly
well acquainted with the manufacture of
war material His Highness decided that if he would
work two days in the week he might employ the
other five as best pleased him. This decision had
a beneficial effect upon the man, and he worked well;
previously his excesses had had a very serious effect
upon his nervous system.</p>

<p>During the conversation that followed the discussion
Mr. Collins happened to mention the game of
chess. His Highness said he should much like to
see the game as played by the English. Mr. Collins
at once challenged me. It was years since I had
played regularly, and the last game I had had was
in Turkestan, when my opponent, after beating me
ignominiously, had finally given me a game out of
courtesy: I never was any good at chess. I said I
would play Mr. Collins if His Highness would give me
the benefit of his advice.</p>

<p>The Amîr said certainly he would do so. Accordingly
the chessmen were brought. A table was
placed in front of His Highness, Mr. Collins sat one
side and I the other, and the game began.</p>

<p>I soon found I was no match for Mr. Collins, and
I relied almost entirely upon the Amîr. I wish I
could remember the details of the game, but I simply
made, mechanically, the moves that the Amîr
directed. We won the game. Mr. Collins said His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
Highness played a bold game with his Castles, and
that he would take a good second class among the
chess players of London.</p>

<p>After that Collins played one of the Courtiers and
beat him. This old man was reckoned to be one of
the best players next to His Highness, and the Amîr
made such unmerciful fun of him for losing, that the
old man wanted to go out and hang himself. However,
he was not allowed to do so, for His Highness
challenged him to a game and beat him. Mr. Pyne
and the others not interested in chess had departed.
For us who stayed, dinner was served, and we left
the Palace at two in the morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foresight of Armenian.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Armenian had been for some little
while preparing winter quarters for me in the west
wing of my house, which faced south and was protected
from the winds.</p>

<p>I had told him that there was no need to make
these elaborate preparations, as I was going away
on leave for the winter. He answered&mdash;</p>

<p>“Per-haps! Per-haps not! I make him ready.”</p>

<p>As the Autumn was drawing to a close I began to
wonder whether leave would indeed be granted to me
for the winter according to His Highness’s words.
I wrote, therefore, to enquire. His Highness answered
that in view of the fact that the cholera, though
doubtless dying out, was still lurking in the town,
he should wish me to remain in the country till the
following spring.</p>

<p>I was glad of my Winter Quarters.</p>

<p>Work at the Hospitals went on as usual until
November, when I was sent for to Paghman to paint
the portrait of Prince Mahomed Omer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>Cholera had died out, but small-pox invaded Kabul,
and in its train came erysipelas.</p>

<p>In Paghman I was located in a khirgar&mdash;the
Turkoman wigwam I have described. It was also my
studio, the light being obtained by moving a flap of
canvas from the top.</p>

<p>Before I commenced the portrait Her Highness
the Sultana sent me a present of sweets and cashmere
embroidery, and when all my preparations were
complete the little Prince, accompanied by his
tutor and Page boys, came for the first sitting.
He asked me to make a sketch of him on paper
before I began the painting. I did so, and handed
it to him. It seemed to amuse him highly, for
he threw back his head and laughed heartily.
Whether the act was a childlike mimicry of his father
or not I cannot say, but it reminded me most strongly
of the Amîr. After that when he came for a sitting
he was always merry and bright, and I managed to
get a really expressive likeness of him. He was
dressed in a gold-embroidered military tunic, hussar
fashion, trousers, high boots, and a fur busby. On
the breast was an emerald surrounded by pearls. The
belt was profusely adorned with diamonds, as was his
watch chain; and on the busby was a large emerald.
His sword hilt and scabbard were of gold. He was
seated in a tall chair, made especially for him; over
the knees, as the weather was cold, was a beautiful
fur rug. On one side of the chair stood his
“Commander-in-Chief,” Mahomed Omer, son of
Perwana Khan, and on the other a Page boy&mdash;a
slave taken in war, who had a singularly pretty face.
This boy, however, had not the intelligent expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
of the Prince, nor had his eyes the brilliancy of his
master’s. It was simply a pretty, weary, mournful
face, and therefore in the picture it did not take from
the beauty of the Prince’s face. The “Commander-in-Chief,”
though intelligent looking, was plain, so that
in looking at the picture the eye was caught immediately
by the Prince’s face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 329px;">

<div class="caption">Prince Mahomed Omer and his Commander-in-Chief<br />
from a photograph by Arthur Collins, F.G.T.</div>
</div>

<p>One day the Prince presented me with a slave boy,
telling me to choose which of his Pages I preferred.
It was rather an embarrassing offer, for one cannot
refuse a gift from a member of the Royal Family,
nor in fact from any Afghan, without offending the
giver. Of what use was a small slave boy to me?
True, I could sell him, or give him away, but my
principles were not in accordance with that line of
action. I therefore told His Highness that I was
busy just then with the painting, but that I would
consider the matter and let him know in the course of
a day or two which boy I preferred. His Highness
forgot all about it, as I hoped he would.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lesson in Courtesy.</div>

<p>Another time he heard one of the Page boys speak
of me as “the Feringhi.” It was remarkable to see
the Prince’s look of indignation and anger, it so exactly
resembled the Amîr’s. He called the boy up and spoke
very severely to him, ordering him in the future to
address me as “Doctor Sahib.” As a punishment he
made him bow to all the other boys and call them
“Sahib.” The Prince was a little over three years of
age at this time.</p>

<p>As there were three portraits instead of one to
paint I was some time at Paghman, and became skilled
in the art of eating pilau and kourma with my fingers,
and eschewing forks and knives, for the Sultana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
had insisted upon my being the guest of the Prince.
I brought with me, beside my guard, the Priest
Compounder, who knew some English, and only
one servant, an Afghan. Accommodation for servants
was limited in Paghman, and though one could allow
an Afghan servant to sleep on the ground in one’s
tent, one could not have a Hindustani in the same
position. In the evenings, after dinner, the Prince’s
“Commander-in-Chief,” little Mahomed Omer, came
in. He sat on the ground and chattered away,
eating grapes while I smoked and aired my
Persian.</p>

<p>While the painting was in progress Mr. Pyne
visited Paghman to hold an interview with the
Amîr; he came and stayed with me. It was snowing
when he arrived, and I found he had fever. As he
sat shivering, unable to get warm, I recommended
the “sandali,” which he had never yet tried. The
charcoal was brought all glowing in the brazier; the
wooden framework and the quilt were arranged, and
we sat on the carpet amidst the large pillows, drawing
the quilt over our knees. There is no need to be
shaking with fever in order to appreciate a sandali:
nevertheless, when one <em>is</em> in that unfortunate position
a sandali seems one of the wisest inventions of man.
Mr. Pyne thought so at the time. I would not,
however, say that a sandali is to be recommended
when more sanitary means of becoming warm are
to be procured. A dose or two of quinine and Mr.
Pyne was soon all right.</p>

<p>We went for a ride the next morning up the
mountain: the snow was not thick and the sun shone
brightly. We reached a gorge sheltered from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
wind, where we could feel the heat of the sun, and
got off and smoked a cigar. I did not get much
painting done while Pyne was my guest, for the
spirit moved him to talk much.</p>

<p>In the dusk of the evening the Priests came and
intoned their prayers near my wigwam. “Allah hû,
Allah-il-Allah, Ressûl Allah!”</p>

<p>When the portrait was finished I sent it to Her
Highness, the Sultana, for approval. She was delighted
with it, but suggested that I had perhaps
made the cheeks too pink: accordingly, I altered it.
She wished me to show it to His Highness, the Amîr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waiting at the Door.</div>

<p>The next day I took it to the Palace. The only
available Interpreter being the “Gnat,” this gentleman
took the opportunity to prevent&mdash;as I afterwards
found&mdash;the report of my arrival from being
taken to the Amîr, and I was kept waiting some
hours, till at last I got up and was leaving the
Palace when I saw His Highness descending the
stairs. I waited, therefore, until he approached, and
then bowed. He seemed surprised to see me and
asked how I was. I showed him the picture which
my servant was carrying. He was very pleased
with it, and said it was faultless: he added&mdash;and
this pleased the Sultana exceedingly&mdash;that
the portrait of the little Prince was exactly like
that I had painted of himself, except that it was
smaller.</p>

<p>The Priest Compounder, who was with me,
mentioned that I had been waiting some hours
at the Palace. His Highness seemed both surprised
and annoyed. He told me that no report
had been made to him of my arrival, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
there was no reason for my having been kept
waiting.</p>

<p>His Highness’s words concerning the painting
were, of course, reported at once to the Sultana, and
she sent word to me that she would be pleased if I
remained at Paghman a day or two longer: the Amîr,
herself, and the Prince would then be departing for
Kabul, and she desired me to accompany the Prince.
I was myself to take charge of the picture on the
journey, and when she summoned me I was to
formally deliver it at the Harem Serai. Accordingly,
I waited.</p>

<p>On the morning of our departure six or seven
bullocks were slaughtered, by order of the Sultana,
and presented to the Paghmanis. The manner
of slaughtering was peculiar. The butcher seized
the nostril and one horn of the victim, twisted
the head sideways over the neck and threw the
animal down. Putting his knee on the horn to extend
the neck, he drew his short knife and cut the
throat: the inevitable “Allah akbar” being shouted at
the same time by the crowd. It was a striking but
disagreeable sight to see the blood hiss on to the
snow: it was so unpleasantly suggestive of what
might happen to oneself under certain circumstances.
The hopeless position of the creatures as they stood
“waiting to be murdered,” rather shook my nerves.
However, it taught me one thing&mdash;that my health
was more affected by the climate than I liked to think:
for on my arrival in Kabul, finding there were two
delicate eye operations waiting for me to perform, I
felt I must postpone them for a day or two.</p>

<p>As the whole Court was moving to Kabul the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
traffic was enormous. We had first snow, then sleet,
then rain, and the road became a quagmire: mud&mdash;we
on horseback were plastered from head to foot.
The Royal family drove in carriages, and those of
the Courtiers who possessed them, in buggies and
tongas. There were several blocks on the road, but
when we got through them we galloped. The
picture was put in a palanquin of the Sultana’s under
the charge of my Afghan servant. The man was
greatly amused at a beggar woman by the wayside
addressing him as “Bibi Sahib,” and asking alms.</p>

<p>For some little time I had been rather worried
about money matters, for although acting upon the
Amîr’s suggestion, I had in August sent a firman
for six months’ pay to my bankers in Bombay, with
orders to collect from the native Agent in that town;
up to now, December, none of it had been paid.
I wished, therefore, to see His Highness and inform
him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The “Gnat.”</div>

<p>The Armenian being engaged in interpreting for
the other Europeans, I had no one to make an appointment
for me with His Highness except the Hindustani
Gnat. A day or two after our arrival in Kabul
this man called at my house, informing me that His
Highness would see me that evening. Knowing that
the truth was to him as naught, I doubted the accuracy
of this information. I was correct in my supposition:
he had made no appointment. However,
it was quite as well I did not see His Highness, for
a day or two afterwards I received a letter from my
bankers saying that at last the Agent had disgorged:
they were able, therefore, to transmit the money to
London. I sent no more firmans to the Agent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before Christmas I was sent for by His
Highness. I managed to obtain possession of the
Armenian, and taking him with me I went to the
Erg Palace. It was on a Friday, and there was no
one at the Palace except the Amîr’s uncle, Sirdar
Usuf, and the ordinary attendants. His Highness
was seated at the sandali. He was not dressed in
European costume, but was wearing a silken robe
and a small white turban. I was afraid His
Highness was unwell and had sent for me on that
account. Happily it was not so. After tea had
been drank he told me that in the Palace when
prayer-time came many people prayed, and that
there were hanging on the walls pictures representing
people&mdash;the English Houses of Parliament,
and also the portrait of himself that I had painted
in Turkestan. In the Mahomedan religion, he explained,
it is not allowed to pray in any room where
there is a pictorial representation of a man. He
said that he wished, therefore, to hang these pictures
in another room, and he desired me to paint
three large pictures of scenery to take their place:
the pictures were to be painted on leather, so that
they might last as long as the Palace itself!</p>

<p>He desired me, for the second time, to paint a
full-length portrait of himself, and expressed his
intention of sending to me four of the most accomplished
artists that the country could produce in
order that I might give them instruction in portrait-painting.
Also, he informed me that my
leave of absence would be granted before “Nau
Rôz,” March 21st.</p>

<p>It occurred to me at the time that with all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
commissions on hand, Nau Rôz and after Nau Rôz
would see me still in Kabul.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Turban.</div>

<p>I do not know what emotion my face expressed,
but as I sat holding my turban on my knee, His
Highness suddenly desired me to bring him the
turban that he might examine it. It was a good
“Lungi,” of fawn-coloured Cashmere, embroidered
on both sides, which had been given me by a patient,
one of the Court Pages. His Highness said he
was wearing a better kind that he had lately sent
for from Cashmere, and he directed a Page to
bring it. It certainly was better than mine; a
white Cashmere delicately embroidered with silk. It
was wound in the Amîr’s careless fashion round
a Turkestan cap of bright colours. I was admiring
it when, to my surprise, His Highness directed me
to put it on.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation at being covered in
his presence I did so, and His Highness desired me
to keep it.</p>

<p>Gratification and pride were now the dominant
sensations; disappointment vanished into the haze
of the past. No longer was “leave of absence”
remembered. What was “Nau Rôz” or “after Nau
Rôz?” Was I not wearing the King’s turban! The
congratulations that everyone offered when I withdrew
from the Presence were received with a lofty
dignity suitable to the situation.</p>

<p>I had only a strip or so of canvas, and I painted a
head on leather to show His Highness how difficult
it was, for me at any rate, to get anything like an
effect on that material, and I pointed out the fact that
a skin of leather large enough for a landscape was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
almost impossible to obtain. A message, therefore,
was sent to Bombay for canvas and paints.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, Mr. Pyne and the other English
called upon Mr. Collins and myself, who were living
in the town, and after a ride in the afternoon, we all
dined together in the Workshops, drinking the health
of the Queen, standing. A congratulatory message
also was sent to Her Majesty from the Kabul Colony,
to be telegraphed from Peshawur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Afghan Artists.</div>

<p>Two days after Christmas the most skilled of the
artists arrived at my house to learn portrait-painting.
They could all draw, and one of them showed talent
of no mean order. The first thing, I found, was to
teach them to draw a head life-size: formerly, they
would do one the size of the thumb nail. The next,
to teach them to draw heads in different positions, and
not in the one conventional position to which they
were accustomed; after that to show them how to put
in their shadows crisply and with decision, having due
regard to the relative value of each. For models I
called up my Afghan servants and the soldiers of the
guard. I have brought away with me many of the
drawings of these artists, so that I have an interesting
series of “types” of men born and bred in
Afghanistan. The most skilful of the artists gave an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
almost Holbeinesque look to his drawings. They were
perhaps somewhat hard, though he began to acquire,
before I left, a freer style of drawing.</p>

<p>How they would have turned out as colourists I do
not know, for we never got on to painting.</p>

<p>At the beginning of January I received an order
from the Sultana to present formally to the little
Prince Mahomed Omer the portrait I had painted of
him in Paghman.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the Armenian, I went to the Erg
Palace. The little Prince’s quarters were in a part
of the Palace to which I had never before been
admitted. It was a recent addition, built at the
extreme west, behind the enclosure of the Amîr’s
Pavilion, and high up overlooking the moat. I had
noticed the building in progress when I was attending
the Amîr, and had wondered whom the
apartments were intended for. We were conducted
up a flight of winding stone steps, along corridors
and through ante-rooms, till we reached the
Prince’s quarters. There were both “winter”
and “summer” rooms, and the little Prince himself
conducted me in a dignified manner to the different
apartments, and showed them to me with great
pride.</p>

<p>The winter rooms, where he was at that time
located, were warmly curtained and carpeted, and on
the hearth, at either end, a great wood fire was blazing.
The summer room, more elaborately decorated, opened
on to a stone platform or balcony, some twenty feet
above the moat, and from here was a splendid view
across the Shahbagh Valley to the Baghi-Buland,
where the Amîr was building himself another Palace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
In the distance was the Paghman offshoot of the
Hindu Kush range.</p>

<p>Sweets, tea, and cigarettes were brought, some
Cashmere embroidery was given me, and a large tray
of sweetmeats for the servants to carry away. The
Sultana also desired me to accept a present of a
thousand rupees as soon as it was collected from the
“tax-payers.” I, however, left the country before it
was collected, but I have heard since that the Amîr
was so annoyed at the delay that he fined Her Highness
an equal sum in consequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Little Prince as a Host.</div>

<p>The little Prince was very smart in a crimson velvet
coat, with emerald and diamond ornaments, white
cloth trousers, patent-leather boots, and a fur busby.</p>

<p>The accommodation in the Palace for the little
man was more elaborate than that provided for any of
his elder brothers, and he was deputed at this early
age to receive visitors on behalf of the Sultana.</p>

<p>He received Mr. Collins and myself in these rooms
some time afterwards, when we paid a ceremonial visit
to Her Highness, and after ordering tea and cigarettes
to be brought, he proceeded to entertain us in the way
that struck him as most suitable&mdash;he sent for his toys.
They were mechanical ones from London and Paris.
There was a musical cat that played the violin, another
that sprang from a basket, and so on. He gave a
demonstration of their working, watching our faces at
the time to see if we were amused. We were duly
amused. He seemed highly delighted, for he suddenly
ordered us to laugh once more. We promptly obeyed.
He asked us then if we would like some sweets: on
our assenting, called for pen and paper and wrote an
order upon his storekeeper for a tray full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>The writing, however, was understandable only
by those who had heard the order given. When the
sweets were brought he warned us not to eat them
too fast lest we should be ill. He seemed not disinclined
to join us, but his tutor hinted to him in
a whisper that he had eaten enough already.</p>

<p>He spoke in Persian, and I asked if he understood
Pushtu. The tutor said that he did not at present
speak that language, but that he was learning. The
Prince, eager to show his knowledge, said that, on the
contrary, he could speak Pushtu, and he gave us an
example. He had apparently picked up the words
from some of his attendants, for it was not language
such as a Prince should use. When we asked
permission to withdraw, the Prince shook hands with
us, politely saying, “Khush-amadêd,” “Welcome,”
and we bowed ourselves out.</p>

<p>In January the frost making the ground so hard
and slippery that it was dangerous to ride on horseback,
Mr. Collins and I went for long afternoon
walks. One day, having made rather a longer round
than usual, we arrived at the suburbs of the town just
as night fell. It was a part of the town I had never
been in before; however, there was a moon, and we
had a soldier with us. The streets of Kabul, as I
have already said, are not straight and neatly paved
and lighted. They are most eccentric in their general
arrangement, and are lit by an occasional&mdash;a very
occasional&mdash;oil lamp, a saucer of earthenware with a
wick thrown in, which gives but a dim smoky light.
There were a great many people about, but few
took any notice of us or we of anyone. Occasionally
some one would say, “The English Doctor,” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
“English,” and though I wore native costume with
turban and cloak, Collins was dressed as a European,
with fur cap and coat. A few years ago a walk in
the dusk in Kabul would certainly have been fatal to
two Europeans, but now&mdash;we had no weapons and
needed none. There seemed really less danger than
there would have been in walking through some of
the back streets of London.</p>

<p>At the end of February when my three landscapes
were finished, I took them, with some drawings that
my pupils had finished, to show to the Amîr.</p>

<p>His Highness was occupying a suite of rooms in
the Erg Palace that at one time was Prince Habibullah’s
Harem Serai. We were shown into a large,
well-furnished room with a wood fire burning on the
hearth. A small scent-fountain was playing on the
table, and the room was crowded with flowers, some
cut and some growing in pots. The Amîr being fond
of flowers, his Palace is supplied during the winter
from Jelalabad, where the climate is always hot.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Shock.</div>

<p>There were not many people in the room&mdash;some
half-dozen of the chief officials of the country and
several Page boys. The Amîr himself did not look
well. He was dark under the eyes and thinner, and
he looked as though he had been bled.</p>

<p>I asked if he were not well, and he said he had
been troubled with gout.</p>

<p>This gave me a shock, and when I found that he
had again called the Hakims to attend him, I at once
determined to leave his service at the first opportunity.
I had a very vivid recollection of my former
experiences under similar circumstances, and had not
the slightest desire to have them repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span></p>

<p>His Highness was very kind and courteous, and
he was pleased with the landscapes. He desired me
however, to paint two more, one of them to be a
view of Paghman, including the Palace and the Harem
Serai.</p>

<p>I was surprised at this and far from pleased, for
the snow lay thick at Paghman, and sketching there
would be an impossibility for weeks to come. I
said to His Highness that there were as yet no leaves
on the trees, but he said&mdash;</p>

<p>“Khair ast!” “That is nothing&mdash;you can paint
leaves on the trees in the picture!”</p>

<p>I showed him the work of the art students, and
he was greatly pleased with their progress.</p>

<p>As the Armenian was ill with fever I had been
compelled to take the Hindustani Gnat to translate,
and I said to him:</p>

<p>“Seeing that His Highness has been ill and has
not desired me to treat him, he probably does not
wish me to return to this country when my leave
expires. Enquire if this is so.”</p>

<p>The Interpreter said in Persian to His Highness:
“The Doctor asks whether it is Amîr Sahib’s wish
that he bring Mrs. Gray with him to this country
when he returns?”</p>

<p>I had not asked this. His Highness answered:</p>

<p>“Most certainly; I said so before,” and addressing
me he said:</p>

<p>“I look upon you as one of my household; I wish
you and your wife to live here permanently: going
to England for a time and again returning.”</p>

<p>He then repeated his promise of defraying the
expenses of the journey and that of the two English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
maid-servants who were to be brought; he indicated
the position where a house was to be built for us,
near his own Palace, and talked for some time as to
the arrangement of the house; and he said as regards
the veil over the face, that it was, for a European
lady, entirely optional.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cogitation: Decision.</div>

<p>It was very kind of His Highness to make these
promises, but of what use were they to me? I had
returned to the country after my first leave because
I had promised to do so: I had imagined, and,
indeed, had been given to understand, that having
tested my good faith, the Amîr would, if he were
taken ill, not keep me as a sort of <i>dernier ressort</i>, but
call me to attend him before he was maltreated by
the Hakims. Apparently this was not his intention.
Such being the case, his service appeared to me to
be no longer desirable, at any rate for a married man.
The risks were too great.</p>

<p>I set to work and painted one landscape, and when
that was finished and I was waiting for the weather
to allow me to go to Paghman, I painted for my wife
a portrait of myself in costume, for I guessed I should
never paint another portrait of myself in Kabul.</p>

<p>About the middle of March I had again an interview
with His Highness: I wished to show him the
progress of my art pupils, and to exhibit the fresh
landscape. He was then occupying the “Bostan
Serai,” a new Palace or bungalow which was just
completed. It was situated outside the South Gate of
the Erg Palace.</p>

<p>I had set the artists to draw a portrait of the
Armenian (to ensure at the interview the presence
of an Interpreter whom I could trust), and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
sergeant of my guard. They and the pupils
accompanied me to the Palace, the Hindustani Gnat
attaching himself to our train.</p>

<p>After passing through a courtyard where there
were soldiers and Page boys, we entered the garden
of the Palace. I sat on a seat there while His Highness
was informed of my arrival.</p>

<p>Some military Officers and Secretaries came
through whom I knew and shook hands with.
Presently came the two little Princes, Hafiz Ullah and
Amin Ullah, pretty boys, with fair hair and white
skins. They stopped and spoke to me, and the
elder, Prince Hafiz Ullah, showed me some photographs
of himself that were taken by an itinerant
Hindu photographer who had recently come to
Kabul: they were very badly done. The Princes
then shook hands and went in to salaam His Highness.
They were accompanied by their tutor and
several Page boys.</p>

<p>In a few minutes I was called. His Highness was
seated in an easy-chair in the porch overlooking the
garden. Everyone was standing. The porch was
three or four steps higher than the terrace where
I stood. After the usual salutations I showed the
landscape. His Highness was very interested in it,
and I then exhibited the portrait of myself. This he
said was faultless. He added, laughingly,</p>

<p>“You have painted the fur the same colour as the
moustache, and the turban the same colour as the
eyes.”</p>

<p>By his direction it was then fixed up on the wall
in front of him.</p>

<p>When the drawings of the pupils were brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
forward the Armenian and the sergeant had to stand
in position in order to be compared with the drawings.
Some of them His Highness praised, some he found
fault with, but he expressed himself as being very
pleased with the progress the artists had made, and
stated his intention of giving each of them a present.
Before I came away I said to the Interpreter:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If His Highness will accept the portrait I have
painted of myself I shall be honoured, but, if not, will
he kindly allow me to send it to my wife in London?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amîr’s Kindly Remark.</div>

<p>His Highness said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I would rather see your face here for many
years to come than have the best portrait that ever
was painted.”</p>

<p>I was gratified by the kindness of the remark:
but it occurred to me that His Highness had received
information concerning my intention of leaving his
service.</p>

<p>At this time the English miner returned from
Jigdilik, where he had been superintending the Spinel
Rubies mines. As there was no room in the Workshops
I offered him quarters in my house. He lived
in the wing that Mr. Collins occupied.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards he bought a half-bred
bulldog of a man in the bazaar, and he tied
it up in my garden. Every evening he went off to
the Workshops to play cards with the other men, and
the dog lifted up his voice and howled continuously.
Looking at the affair from my own personal
standpoint, the dog was undoubtedly an abominable
nuisance, but from the miner’s point of view, probably
this was not so. I considered in my own mind
whether it would purely be selfish if I told him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
take his dog with him, or otherwise dispose of
it: I felt sorely tempted to do so, but I refrained.
I did casually remark that the dog mourned greatly
when he was away; the hint did not have the desired
effect, for the miner shouted cheerily, “Did he?”
and he laughed a stentorian laugh. It was an experience
to go through, when he and the Armenian
shouted jokes at one another in my small winter
room. However, he was my guest at the time; but
I confess I looked upon it as a special mercy that he
was fond of cards and the society of the other English
workmen at the shops.</p>

<p>But the dog! I remember it. He began with a
short yelp, which he prolonged into a whining howl.
Then he began another howl, and ended up with two
or three sharp yelps: there were many changes and
variations all painfully distinct in the silence of the
night. One evening it was almost too much for me,
and I nearly gave way: I was about to send a note
to the shops, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miner</span>,&mdash;What is the price of your dog? I
want to buy it, so that I can, without evil motives being
assigned to me, poison it. My nervous system is
becoming slowly shattered. Don’t apologise.&mdash;Yours,
very truly,&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But then, from the miner’s point of view this
would, doubtless, be a very selfish and heartless letter,
and I decided not to send it.</p>

<p>Distinctly there were dogs enough in the
neighbourhood. The Armenian had a dog, and he
would bring it sometimes in the morning and tie
it up all day. This also mourned: I do not like
dogs. It struck me afterwards that perhaps I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
thought to enjoy their music. If the muscles of the
face, in an unguarded moment, twitched spasmodically
at a more than usually penetrating howl, I endeavoured
to change it into a pleasant smile. To a medical
observer I should imagine one’s appearance at these
moments would be interesting.</p>

<p>The day I was nearly forgetting the duties of
hospitality in sending a note to the miner, I had had
an operation to perform, the removal of an eye: the
day before to take a tumour from the forehead: also
to put up the broken wing of a heron in splints.
Prince Habibullah had shot the bird, and finding it
was not killed, he sent it to me to be surgically
attended to. In the morning I had to visit and
prescribe for a sick tiger: this patient, by the way,
broke loose from the attendants, but was too ill to do
any harm.</p>

<p>I was not yet able to start for Paghman on account
of the rain and the violent storms of thunder and
lightning. It was bad enough in Kabul with the
road like quagmires, but up in the hills it would be
infinitely worse. It was rumoured that I was to start
for home directly the Paghman picture was finished;
it was also rumoured that I was not to start till the
end of the summer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shattered Nerves.</div>

<p>Mr. Collins had for some time been considerably
disturbed in his mind, in that he had not been for
several months sent on any geologising expedition.
He was “severely let alone,” and was heartily sick
of Kabul life in consequence. The reason of this I
have mentioned in an earlier part of the narrative,
where I have drawn a parallel between his and
Captain Griesbach’s experiences. The difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
Kabul is to avoid worrying one’s self into misery.
It is galling to think that a spy can whisper what he
likes behind one’s back, and one can do nothing: for
being never accused one has nothing to answer;
knowing, nevertheless, that some mischief is working.
As for rumours, one can believe as little or as much
as one pleases, for a report is just as likely to be
false as true: there is, however, generally some substratum
of fact upon which the structure is built.</p>

<p>At the beginning of April, I received the order to
proceed to Paghman.</p>

<p>His Highness gave me a firman, ordering the
Governor of Paghman to provide a house; food at
the price His Highness pays, and anything else I
wanted. Pack-horses were procured, and I sent off
the servants with camp-bedstead, table, chair, kitchen
utensils, and so on, including tea, sugar, and candles,
and corn for the horses, for in Paghman, at this time
of the year, there was little to be got from the
villagers except meat and bread.</p>

<p>The next day, after breakfast, I rode to Paghman,
accompanied by Mr. Collins and a guard. The snow
was still on the mountains, but had disappeared in
the valley of Paghman. We were quartered in the
house of Sirdar Usuf Khan, the Amîr’s uncle. It
was, of course, empty, except for the furniture I had
sent over. We spent the rest of the day wandering
about the hills and glens, seeking a suitable spot
from which to make my drawings. Mr. Collins
brought a gun and shot a few birds, among them
was a kestrel. I noticed the wild tulips were in
bloom; they had six pale pink petals, each with a
darker median streak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>After walking and climbing a good many miles
we found the best view of the Palace and Harem
Serai was to be obtained from a hilly offshoot of the
mountains bounding the north side of the valley:
from the Pir-i-Buland peak.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Spy of the Gnat.</div>

<p>When we got back to the house, one of my
Afghan servants told me that an <i>employé</i> of the
Hindustani Gnat was hanging about in the neighbourhood,
and that while we were away he had attempted
to enter the house. After we had had dinner,
Mr. Collins and I walked in the garden, and I caught
sight of the man spoken of. I knew his face at once
as a spy. Apparently he had “squared” the guard,
for he was creeping in at the entrance. What
his object was I never knew, unless it were to peep
about and carry a report to his master of what he
saw. Mr. Collins and I suddenly stepped in his
path and asked him what he wanted. He seemed
rather taken aback and said he wanted nothing.</p>

<p>I told him that, as we could not have the
supreme happiness of being of service to him, we
would not detain him longer; nor would we trouble
him to call again lest he should be put to the inconvenience,
not to say danger, of being shot at. He
did not appear again.</p>

<p>In a couple of days I had finished my sketches,
and we rode back to Kabul. I then set to work to
paint my picture. Meanwhile, the Hospital work
had to go on as usual, and operations to be performed,
so that it was the beginning of May before the
picture was finished.</p>

<p>I then took it to the Bostan Serai Palace, which
His Highness was still occupying, to show him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span>
was very pleased, and went over all the details of
the picture with interest. The usual tea and
cigarettes were brought, and His Highness sent me
a plate of sweetmeats from his table. He talked for
some time afterwards on natural history and philology,
and said he was intending to build another
Palace at Paghman. I showed him some vesical
calculi I had removed by operation, and then asked
when he would wish me to start for England. From
the expression of His Highness’s face, I saw I had
made a mistake in asking. However, the expression
was only momentary, and His Highness said I should
start at the beginning of the next month. One thing,
however, he had overlooked; the pictures&mdash;he liked
them exceedingly, and would hang them in the
Palace he was then using&mdash;but for the Erg Palace,
for which they were painted, they were the wrong
shape; these were longer from side to side; they
should have been longer from above downwards.
This was indeed the fact, as I saw directly he called
my attention to it, and I determined, therefore, to
paint three more before I left. But, tobah! tobah!
I was very sick of it all. I set to work again and
called in the art students to see how the deed was
done.</p>

<p>To find what you really can do, work with the
“spur” well in. I painted better than I had ever
done&mdash;though, may be, that is not saying very much.</p>

<p>As soon as one picture was finished I began
another, working all day and every day. The Hospitals
I left in the hands of the Hindustani assistants
and the Hakims; but I was sorry for the patients.
One or two cases, however, I attended to;&mdash;a Page<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
boy, whom His Highness sent, and whose finger it
was necessary to amputate: and one of the keepers
of His Highness’s menagerie, who had been badly
mauled by a tiger: a lithotomy operation that had
to be performed, and a few others.</p>

<p>While I was at work I received a letter from His
Highness, directing me to inform him as soon as I
was ready to start, in order that the firmans for
pack-horses, tent, and guard might be made out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adieux.</div>

<p>Towards the end of May the pictures were
finished. I had at this time the pleasure of congratulating
Prince Nasrullah on the birth of a son;
and after the pictures were presented, His Highness’s
thanks received, and my adieux made, I started
on my long-deferred but greatly-desired journey
home. Mr. Collins, at the same time, sent in his
resignation and accompanied me. Just as I put my
foot in the stirrup two patients arrived:&mdash;the Page
boy from the Palace, whose finger I had amputated,
and a girl from the Harem Serai, sent by the Sultana.
However, I was not very long in attending to them,
and at last we were really off.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.<br />

<span class="smaller smcap">The Argument.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Afghan court life from an English standpoint. The rise and fall of the Afghan
Courtier. Untrustworthiness: the inevitable result. Intrigue: a similar
result. Question of “cause” or “consequence.” Possibility of raising the
moral plane: reasons in favour of. The Amîr’s obvious opinion. His Highness’s
great work. Certain evils. Former condition of the middle classes: present
condition: opening of the eyes: comparison with similar class in India. Progress
in Afghanistan. Civilizing effect of the Amîr: his influence. Dost Mahomed’s
rule: his character: comparison with Abdurrahman. Altered condition of
country. The Amîr’s civilizing measures: drastic measures. Peaceful measures:
education: the teaching of handicrafts: of art: the spreading of knowledge:
prizes for good or original work. Personal fascination of the Amîr.</p></div>


<p>Though I have endeavoured, by detailing my own
experiences in the country, to give an idea of the
present condition of Afghanistan and the character of
the ruler, one must not forget that we English in the
service were on an entirely different footing, as regards
the Amîr, from any of the natives of the country. As
outsiders we noted, sometimes with amused, sometimes
with painful, interest, many occurrences which, however,
concerned us only in the abstract and not in any
personal way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rise and Fall of the Official.</div>

<p>For instance, I have shown that the Amîr has
raised men of the lowest rank, even slaves, to positions
nearly the highest in the kingdom. Similarly, men of
the highest rank are degraded in a day to nearly the
lowest. A high official is one day riding through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
streets dressed in velvet and gold, with a great
retinue of servants around him: a day or two afterwards,
in a shabby coat, he is creeping from door to
door to beg a little bread, and I wondered if this
state of things were the <em>consequence</em>, or is it the <em>cause</em>,
of an Afghan’s utter untrustworthiness, when he is
put into a position of responsibility.</p>

<p>As an example:&mdash;A man is made Governor of
a Province on a very moderate salary, and presently
the Amîr sees him in gorgeous attire, and surrounded
by crowds of servants and horses. We, foreigners
even, could see that the pay did not run to it&mdash;it
was impossible; how much more clearly, therefore,
could the Amîr see it, and yet the custom was invariable.
After a few years the man is recalled to Kabul
to make out a statement of accounts as regards the
revenue and taxes of the province. He cannot do it.
Forthwith his ill-gotten wealth is put in the Treasury,
his finery, and the shawls and diamonds of his wives,
in the Government stores, and he finds himself, as
he deserved, a beggar or in jail. The sufferers&mdash;the
men who have been squeezed&mdash;are the peasants and
traders. When “gentlemen” behave in this way it
is not to be wondered at that the Amîr makes a
slave a gentleman.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are cases, perhaps, as
numerous where a man owes his fall not to any
rascality of his own, but to the combination and
intrigue of his enemies. This, I suppose, must
necessarily be under a despotic Government, where
one man has supreme power. Be he ever so wise
and just a man he cannot know everything, and
there being only one man to work upon, a clever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
scoundrel, who has the <i>entrée</i> to the Durbar, and
who studies that one man’s disposition and moods,
can oust a better man than himself, if he works long
enough. Sometimes a man compounds with his
enemies: each party knows something incriminating
about the other, and both keep silent from mutual
fear. This state of things has existed not in the reign
of the present Amîr only, but for generations.</p>

<p>As a spectator I have watched the play many a
time; it is interesting, as I said, though apt to be
depressing. Sometimes it is simply a comedy; but
more often the ending is tragic.</p>

<p>Are these rapid rises and falls to be looked upon
as the <em>consequence</em> or are they the <em>cause</em> of the moral
condition of the Afghan? The question is an important
one, if we are looking forward to a civilized
Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Does an Afghan in power, knowing the certainty
of a fall, deserved or undeserved, say to himself,</p>

<p>“I have authority now, but sooner or later somebody
will undermine me in the Amîr’s regard. I had
better make the most of my power while it lasts: get
all I can out of other people, and enjoy myself. The
evil day may be long deferred.”</p>

<p>Looking at it in this way, it is possible to imagine
that the condition of things is the cause of his
behaviour.</p>

<p>On the other hand, is the moral nature of the
Afghan utterly hopeless? I do not mean does he lie,
steal, murder, and betray, for we know he has done
that for ages; but I mean, is the nation incapable of
being raised to a higher moral condition?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Amîr’s Great Work.</div>

<p>Their frank open-hearted manner and sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
hospitality; their love of liberty and of home; their
faithfulness (sometimes) to a friend in adversity,&mdash;I
have seen this in spite of widespread treachery; the
graceful gratitude for a favour conferred: all these
seem to show that the moving spirit of the race was
once on a far higher moral plane than it is now, and
one would think, therefore, that they <em>are</em> capable of
being raised to a condition vastly superior to their
present state.</p>

<p>That the Amîr thinks so is clear, for he has
commenced to raise them by a system of education.</p>

<p>To say that Abdurrahman did not come to the
throne by chance is to utter a platitude. There was a
work to be done that doubtless he only could do. It
was essential that the power of the “Barons,” the
great chiefs with rival interests, should be broken and
their constant feuds ended; that the country should
be united under one head; that there should be respect
for authority, and thus a possibility established
of drawing the people from the slough of ignorance in
which they are wallowing. The Amîr has done and
is doing, in this country over which he has acquired
nearly absolute control, a grand civilizing work.</p>

<p>Still, one cannot be blind to the fact that the usual
evils of a Despotic Government exist:&mdash;the instability
of every official appointment: the great evil of the
“place-seeker” to which I have referred: the oppression
of the poor; and the grinding down of the
peasants and traders. These are enough to sap the
life of any government, for there can be no strength
where there is no mutual trust.</p>

<p>It is impossible for the Amîr, though like
Napoleon he employs a complicated system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
espionage, it is impossible for him to know all the
evil that exists. In the preceding reigns the oppression
of the middle and lower classes (the backbone
of every country) was far greater than it is now, but
the people had the continual excitement of constantly-recurring
intertribal wars, when every Afghan is a
soldier, to draw their attention away from their own
miserable condition. Now, they have time to think,
and though their condition is far better than it was,
they are beginning to see how bad it is&mdash;to make
comparisons.</p>

<p>That Afghanistan has during the last ten years
made considerable strides toward civilization, there
can, I think, be no doubt in the minds of those who
have had the opportunity of collecting sufficient facts
upon which to base an opinion. And that this progress
has been entirely due to the remarkable Prince
who is now occupying the throne of Afghanistan&mdash;Amîr
Abdurrahman&mdash;requires but little proof.</p>

<p>We have only to compare the condition of the
country and the “bent” of the people at the present
time with their condition a few years ago, to bring
out, in a very clear light, the civilizing effect of a
far-seeing, strong man’s personality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal Influence of the Amîr.</div>

<p>Amîr Abdurrahman is absolute autocrat of
Afghanistan. His is now the only influence that has
any lasting effect upon the people. There is no
Press to guide public opinion. The influence and
power of the Priests has been enormously curtailed.
The Chief Priest&mdash;the Khani Mullah Khan himself&mdash;though
treated with respect by His Highness, the
Amîr, has scarcely more power, nor does he receive
a greater share of attention than one of the Civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
magistrates. The opinion of the Amîr, delivered in
open Durbar, is the keynote from which all tunes are
played. It is caught up by the Chamberlains, the
Court Officials, and Pages; it reaches the bazaars,
and soon the people join in the chorus. It is woe to
the man who utters a discordant note: people look at
him askance and draw out of his neighbourhood.
Attention is directed to him, and unless he alters his
note he is&mdash;dismissed from the choir.</p>

<p>The Amîr is, as I have said, the Chief of the
powerful Durani tribe. This tribe has been from time
immemorial more tolerant and more civilized than any
other of the tribes of Afghanistan: and from it the
native rulers of the country have been invariably
drawn. When we consider the Amîr’s marvellous
personal influence, we can but see it is a happy thing
that his leaning is towards civilization and justice.</p>

<p>That it is so can be shown.</p>

<p>What was the condition of Afghanistan no further
back than the time of his grandfather, Amîr Dôst
Mahomed, the great Amîr&mdash;“Amîr-i-Kabir”&mdash;as the
Afghans called him?</p>

<p>Dôst Mahomed was Amîr of the Kabul Province;
his brother Ramdil occupied Kandahar: and Herat
was held independently by Shah Mahomed, brother
of Shah Shujah. This was in 1835. These chiefs
were constantly intriguing with Persia and Russia;
and their conflicting interests and personal jealousies
brought the country into a condition so unsettled
as to be little better than Anarchy. War, and in
its train, robbery and murder were so constantly
carried on, that it was most unsafe for Afghans,
and quite impossible for foreigners, to travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
from one city to another. So suddenly did fighting
break out, that when travelling, one found one’s self
in danger of falling into the thick of it. Caravans&mdash;such
as ventured to start&mdash;made long and wearisome
detours to avoid battlefields. The more savage of
the Afghan tribes delighted in nothing more than the
chances thus offered of unpunished highway robbery
and murder.</p>

<p>About the year 1850 Dôst Mahomed succeeded in
annexing Turkestan, and in 1854 he managed to evict
Ramdil from Kandahar. Meanwhile, in Herat, Shah
Kamran succeeded his father, Mahmud; and at
his death came his minister, Yar Mahomed. The
Persians at once advanced and took Herat: Herat
being the key of India&mdash;this necessitated British
interference. Sultan Jan, brother of Dôst Mahomed,
was put in possession. He died in 1862, and there
were many claimants for the Chieftainship, each of
whom appealed to Persia. Dôst Mahomed therefore
advanced with an army, besieged, and took Herat.
This was his last act, for he died in his camp a few
days after.</p>

<p>While Dôst Mahomed was on the throne it was
allowable in Kabul to revile and curse the British
openly, and although as a successful Warrior, with
bluff, hearty manners, and a free accessibility to his
people, he was a popular Monarch, nevertheless, there
was not a single act he did which in any way increased
the material prosperity of his people. To use the
words of a skilled and indefatigable observer of facts,
Dr. Bellew, of whom one still hears much in Kabul&mdash;“Dôst
Mahomed, during his long reign, did nothing
to improve the condition or advance the domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
welfare of his people, nor did he introduce a single
measure of general benefit to his country. He kept
it a close borough of Islam, stationary in the ignorance
of the Middle Ages, and pervaded with the religious
bigotry of that period, and, to the close of his life he
defended that policy as the only one whereby to
maintain the independence of the country. His great
merit is that he had the sense to perceive his own
interest in the British alliance, and he reaped the
fruits of his good judgment in the ultimate consolidation
of his kingdom. But he was a barbarian,
nevertheless.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Abdurrahman and Dôst Mahomed.</div>

<p>Attention has been drawn to a certain resemblance
existing between Amîr Abdurrahman and Dôst
Mahomed.</p>

<p>The Hon. G. N. Curzon, speaking at the Society
of Arts, remarked that the Amîr seemed to possess
some of the strongest characteristics of his grandfather,
Dôst Mahomed. Without doubt this is so;
and one may add that to the strong character of Dôst
Mahomed, Abdurrahman unites a high degree of
education and considerable stores of information&mdash;scientific,
artistic, and general&mdash;acquired from books,
from conversation, and from observation during his
travels. To the simple manners and free hospitality
of Dôst Mahomed, he adds a dignity and kindly
courtesy of manner most remarkable in a man of his
strong passions, and in one who is constantly surrounded
with adulation and flattery. He is readily
accessible to his people: and even when suffering
from the pangs of gout will listen patiently to the
petitions of the poorest of his subjects, and give rapid
though just judgments in the cases brought before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>From my narrative may have been gathered some
idea of the steps that the Amîr has taken to civilize
his people and advance them in prosperity. Highway
robbery and murder are no longer common in the
country; nor is murder or theft in the town. Englishmen&mdash;Feringhis&mdash;have
been, for the last six or seven
years, travelling constantly between Kabul and
Peshawur, and never has there been the slightest
attempt to injure or annoy them. Indeed, for myself
I may say that at every halting-place when the
villagers brought their sick for me to attend to, I
went among them freely, unarmed and unguarded.</p>

<p>That the Amîr should have used drastic measures
to bring the diseased state of the country into a condition
nearer approaching health, was without doubt a
necessity; mild measures would have been misunderstood
and completely disregarded. The savage tribes
who haunted certain parts of the highway and gave rise
to such by-words as “the valley of death,” were
either killed by the Amîr’s troops, captured and
executed, or dispersed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, should a Kabuli wish to start
business for himself, he has but to apply to the Amîr,
who will, for a certain number of years, lend him a sum
sufficient for his purposes, and this without interest.</p>

<p>I have related in my narrative how that the Amîr
was educating, not merely the Court Pages and the
boy soldiers of his Mahomedan regiment, but many
others, the sons of gentlemen, whom he was intending
for officers in his army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Teaching of Handicrafts.</div>

<p>The educational influence on the Afghans of the
Amîr’s Kabul workshops must be, and is, immense.
The natives work in great numbers in the shops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
being taught by the English engineers who have
from time to time been in the service of His
Highness, and by the Hindustani <i>mistris</i>, who have
been introduced from Lahore and Bengal.</p>

<p>Not only is war material produced in the workshops,
but various handicrafts are practised there.
One body of men is doing leather work&mdash;copying
English and Russian boots of various kinds; making
saddles, bridles, belts, and cartridge pouches, portmanteaux,
and mule trunks. There are workers
in wood&mdash;from those who manage the steam saws
to those who produce beautiful carved work for
cabinets and chairs. There are workers in brass,
making vases, candelabra, lamps, and many other
things both useful and ornamental. There is another
department where they produce tin ware&mdash;pots, pans,
and cans. The most artistic are perhaps the workers
in silver. They make for the Amîr or Sultana very
beautiful things: cups, beakers, beautifully embossed
tea-pots, dagger and sword handles, and scabbards.
Their work is, however, rarely original. The Amîr
shows them a drawing or gives them a good English
model to copy from.</p>

<p>Everything European is now fashionable in Kabul,
and European clothing has become more universally
worn by the Kabulis than it used to be even at the
time I entered the service of the Amîr. His
Highness, therefore, finding that his tailors, though
they soon learnt the shape of European garments,
had not mastered the difficulties of “fit,” sent for
an English tailor to teach them. Classes were held
on the subject in the workshops and demonstrations
given, with the result that such of the Kabuli tailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
who attended greatly improved in their system of
“cutting,” and obtained much better prices in the
bazaars.</p>

<p>I have already related how that the Amîr desired
me to start an Art class, and with what success the
artists learnt to draw.</p>

<p>It would be tedious and almost impossible for me
to enumerate all the different kinds of work carried
on in the shops; but I think I have said enough to
show that the effects of the workshops, apart from the
output, must be immense. There are some thousand
or fifteen hundred men at work in them; these scatter
to their homes at night and carry the wonderful
stories of all they see and do to their friends. In
fact, the most popular song of the day is one depicting
the life of a lad in the shops. It is supposed to
be sung by the mother; but it ends somewhat significantly
by the workman being caught in the machinery
and killed.</p>

<p>One must remember that this educational system
of civilizing is being carried on among a race of men
who have been known hitherto simply as fighters and
robbers, semi-savages, and who, unlike so many of the
races of India, have shown but little if any sign that
they were capable of being converted into useful
producers.</p>

<p>When I say, finally, that the Amîr offers prizes,
and of considerable value, for the best or most original
work produced either in the shops or elsewhere, it
will be easily understood how much he has at heart
the desire to advance his people in knowledge and
civilization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal Fascination of the Amîr.</div>

<p>For a man of ordinary intelligence, such as myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
to attempt to analyze the Amîr’s character would be
both presumptuous and futile. His intellect, though
perhaps more subtile than profound; and his wide
knowledge, though more superficial than real, raise
him high above those by whom he is surrounded,
and by contrast he shines as a brilliant light among
the dull flames of his Courtiers. European in
appearance, hearty in manner, with a robe of educated
civilization, His Highness is Afghan&mdash;an Afghan of
the Afghans, and perhaps the finest specimen of his
race&mdash;but yet an Oriental.</p>

<p>We English in his service, dazzled by the glamour
of his strong personality and charmed by the kindly
courtesy of his manner, grew to feel an attachment
strong and personal to His Highness; but there were
those among us of the more observant who felt, as
the years passed, that we were but as “Pawns” on
the chess-board of this Prince, to be swept off with
an unshrinking hand when a move in the game might
need it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though life at an Oriental Court
offers so little that is congenial to the tastes of an
educated Englishman; where, indeed, each man strives
to harm his neighbour; where truth is not, nor
honour; where Vice and Villainy walk at noonday
unveiled, such is the fascination of the Man that, had
one none to consider but one’s self, the temptation,
for his sake, to re-enter the life would be almost
irresistible.</p>
